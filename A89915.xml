            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>God</hi> two things are to be beleeued: 1. the <hi>attributes</hi> of the eſſence. 2. the <hi>trinitie</hi> of the perſons. The attributes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the nature and proprieties of God; ſuch as are, his <hi>power, glory, knowledge,</hi> and the like; of the power of God, yee may read, Chap. 1.11. &amp; 2.12. of the glory of God, Chap. 1.11. &amp; 3.17. of the knowledge of God Chap. 3.10.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſons</hi> are three, the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> chap: 1.2.12. &amp; 3.17. of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> chap. 1.2.13.15. &amp;c. of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> chap. 2.19. Thus of God.</p>
            <p>In the conſideration of the <hi>world,</hi> faith is taken vp eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the <hi>creation</hi> of it, and the <hi>gouernment</hi> of it. In the <hi>creation</hi> it viewes the mightie workemanſhip of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all things of nothing, euen the very Angels, as well as men and other creatures. Of the creation, chap. 1.16. of Angells alſo chap. 1.16. both good, chap. 2.9. and euill, chap. 2.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The gouernment of the world,</hi> is two waies to be conſidered: Firſt, in the generall diſpoſing and preſeruation of all things. Secondly, and principally, faith is taken vp about the conſideration of the gouernment of <hi>Men</hi> in the world: of the <hi>generall prouidence,</hi> chap. 1.16.17.</p>
            <p>The prouidence of God ouer man, may be conſidered according to his fourefold eſtate: 1. of <hi>Innocencie.</hi> 2. of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> 3. of <hi>Grace.</hi> 4. of <hi>Glorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the eſtate of <hi>Innocencie,</hi> faith chiefly beholds and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the glorious <hi>Image of God,</hi> in which man was created; of this Image you may read, chap. 3.10. by analogie.</p>
            <p>In the ſtate of <hi>Corruption,</hi> two things do offer themſelues to our dolefull contemplation: 1. <hi>ſinne,</hi> 2. the <hi>puniſhment of ſin. Sinne</hi> is both <hi>originall</hi> and <hi>actuall:</hi> of originall ſinne, chap. 2.13. of actuall ſinnes, chap. 2.11.13.3.5.6. of the puniſhment of ſinne, chap. 3.25. &amp; 2.13. &amp; 3.6.</p>
            <p>In the ſtate of <hi>Grace,</hi> faith viewes three things: 1. the <hi>meanes of grace.</hi> 2. the <hi>ſubiect.</hi> 3. the <hi>degrees.</hi> The meanes is either <hi>before time,</hi> or <hi>in time:</hi> before time, tis the <hi>election of God;</hi> of which, chap. 3.12. in time, the meanes chiefly is
<pb facs="tcp:4894:27"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>couenant</hi> in him. <hi>In Chriſt,</hi> two things are to be conſidered, his <hi>perſon,</hi> and his <hi>office.</hi> The <hi>theorie</hi> concerning Chriſts <hi>perſon,</hi> is twofold: 1. concerning his <hi>two natures.</hi> 2. concerning his <hi>twofold eſtate</hi> in thoſe natures. The <hi>natures</hi> of Chriſt are two, <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>diuine,</hi> ioyned in the bond of <hi>perſonall vnion;</hi> of the humane nature, chap. 1.22. of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, chap. 1.15.16, &amp;c. of the <hi>vnion</hi> of both, chap. 2.9. The <hi>ſtate</hi> of the perſon of Chriſt is twofold: 1. of <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. of <hi>exaltation.</hi> His <hi>humiliation</hi> comprehends, 1. his <hi>incarnation,</hi> as the antecedent. 2. his <hi>obedience</hi> to the law of Moſes. 3. his <hi>paſsion:</hi> of his incarnation and obedience impliedly in diuers places; of his paſsion, chap. 1.14.20.22, 14, 15. His <hi>exaltation</hi> comprehends his <hi>reſurrection, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,</hi> and <hi>ſeſsion at the right hand of God:</hi> of his reſurrection, chap: 2.12: of his ſitting at Gods right hand, chap. 3.1.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>perſon</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>office</hi> of Chriſt is to mediate between God and man. The parts are 1. his <hi>propheticall office.</hi> 2. His <hi>prieſtly office.</hi> 3. his <hi>regall office.</hi> His <hi>propheticall office</hi> ſtands in propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of doctrine, and in making it effectuall by his ſpirit. His <hi>priestly office</hi> ſtandeth in two things: 1. <hi>Expiation of ſin.</hi> 2. <hi>Interceſsion for vs to God.</hi> His <hi>regall office</hi> is partly in the gouernment of the Church, as <hi>the head thereof:</hi> and partly in the ſubduing of the enemies of God and the Church; of the treaſures of wiſdom in Chriſt as a Prophet, chap. 2.3. of the ſacrifice of Chriſt as a Prieſt, chap. 2.14. of the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt ouer the Church, chap. 1.18. &amp; 2.19.</p>
            <p>Thus of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>couenant</hi> followeth, which is conſidered both in it ſelfe, and in the <hi>ſeales</hi> of it. Though the <hi>couenant of workes</hi> be accidentally a meanes to driue vs to Chriſt, yet the proper effectuall meanes is the <hi>couenant of grace,</hi> which God hath made with the elect in Chriſt: this being recorded in the word of the Goſpell both in the old and new Teſtament, is the ordinarie meanes, by the power of Chriſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert ſoules to God, by the preaching of it in the miniſtery of his ſeruants; of this chap. 1.6.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4894:28"/>
            <p>The <hi>ſeales</hi> of this <hi>couenant</hi> are the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> both of the old and new Teſtament: of the old teſtament, was <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> and the reſt; of which chap. 2.11. of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are <hi>baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> of baptiſme, ch. 2.12</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>meanes</hi> of grace. The <hi>ſubiect</hi> of true grace is the <hi>Church,</hi> the body of Chriſt vnited to him by myſticall vnion. The Church conſiſts of two ſorts of men, <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>people;</hi> of the Church in generall with her vnion with Chriſt, chap. 1.18, 19, 20. &amp; 2.19. of Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with their duties, chap. 1.25.28. &amp; 2.1. and in diuers other places.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>ſubiect</hi> alſo. The degrees of grace in the third eſtate, are 1. <hi>vocation.</hi> 2. <hi>faith.</hi> 3. <hi>remiſsion of ſinnes</hi> 4. <hi>ſanctification.</hi> of vocation, chap. 3.15. of faith, chap 1.4.23. &amp; 2.12. of remiſſion of ſinnes, chap. 1.14. &amp; 2.13. of ſanctification, in both parts, both mortification, chap. 3.5.8. and viuification, chap. 2.13. &amp; 3.10.</p>
            <p>Thus of the eſtate of grace.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt eſtate of man, is the <hi>eſtate of glorie;</hi> which ſtands of three degrees. 1. <hi>reſurrection.</hi> 2. <hi>the laſt iudgement.</hi> and 3. <hi>life eternall.</hi> of reſurrection, chap. 1.18. of the laſt iudgement and eternall glory, chap. 3.4. And thus of the firſt part of the <hi>patterne of wholeſome words,</hi> and that is <hi>faith:</hi> now followeth the ſecond, and that is <hi>loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loue</hi> comprehends all the duties we owe to God or men, as being <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> which ties together all holy ſeruices. Loue muſt bee conſidered both in the <hi>adiuncts,</hi> and in the <hi>ſorts</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>adiuncts</hi> are <hi>conſtancie, wiſedom, zeale, care to auoide offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the like of loue in generall, chap. 1.4. &amp; 2.2. &amp; 3.14. of conſtancie, ch. 2.6. of zeale, chap. 4.13. of wiſdome and care to auoide offences, chap. 4.5. thus of the adiuncts.</p>
            <p>The ſorts of works comprehended vnder loue, are two chiefly: 1. <hi>works of worſhip.</hi> 2. <hi>workes of virtue.</hi> The works of worſhip are either <hi>internall</hi> onely, or <hi>externall</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> alſo. The <hi>internall</hi> are, the <hi>acknowledging of God, the loue of God, the feare of God, the trust or hope in God,</hi> and which
<pb facs="tcp:4894:28"/> floweth from thence, <hi>patience.</hi> of the acknowledgement of God, chap. 1.9, 10. of the loue of God, chap. 1.8. of the feare of God, chap. 3.22. of the hope in God, chap. 1.5. of patience, chap. 1.11. The workes of worſhip that are both <hi>externall</hi> and <hi>internall,</hi> are <hi>praier</hi> and <hi>thankeſgiuing.</hi> of prayer, chap. 4.2, 3. of thankeſgiuing, chap. 3.17.</p>
            <p>Thus of workes of worſhip. <hi>Workes of virtue</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our ſelues or others: the workes that concerne our ſelues, are chiefly two: the <hi>ſtudie of heauenly things,</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</hi> Temperance containes <hi>chaſtitie</hi> and <hi>ſobriety</hi> in the vſe of all ſorts of earthly things. of the ſtudie of heauenly things, chap. 3.1, 2. of chaſtitie, ch. 3.5. of ſobriety, ch. 3.2.</p>
            <p>Thus of vertue that concernes our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Works of virtue towards others, are chiefly nine. <hi>Mercy, curteſie, humilitie, meekeneſſe, long-ſuffering, clemencic, peaceablenes, thankfulnes and iuſtice:</hi> of the firſt eight of theſe, chap. 3.12. to 16. Now <hi>Iuſtice</hi> is either publike or priuate: <hi>publike Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> is in Magiſtrates, of which, chap. 2.5. <hi>priuate Iuſtice,</hi> is either <hi>commutatiue,</hi> in bargaining, or <hi>diſtributiue,</hi> in giuing that which is right to euery one according to his degree, and ſo diſtributiue Iuſtice is either ciuill or oeconomicall. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Iuſtice in ciuill conuerſation with men abroad, is either to Magiſtrates, of which, chap. 1.5. or to all men, and ſo conſiſts of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulnes</hi> with <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>obſeruance.</hi> oeconomical Iuſtice is that which concernes the houſhold; and ſo containes the duties of husbands and wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and parents, ſeruants and maſters; of which chap. 3.18. to the end, with the firſt verſe of chap. 4.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo of <hi>Loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue ſhewed the excellent compleatnes of this worthy ſcripture: it remaines that I declare ſome of the reaſons that haue emboldned me to make choice of your <hi>Honors</hi> names for the dedication of my expoſition vpon this ſcripture. Three things ſwaying Godly men in like caſe, haue compelled mee, <hi>protection, obſeruance,</hi> and <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.</hi> the preaching of this doctrine, as by the mercy of
<pb facs="tcp:4894:29"/> God it wrought abundant conſolation and comfortable reformation in many hearers, ſo did it ſeldom reſt from the aſſaults and calumnies, which one while <hi>prophaneneſſe,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while <hi>enuie</hi> powred out vpon it. Great cauſe there is therfore that it comming out now to a more publike view, ſhould ſeeke ſhelter: and of whom ſhould I ſeeke it or hope for it ſooner then of your Honors, who are pleaſed by your daily countenance to aſſure me a iuſt patronage? For the ſecond, to omit the high reputation which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eminencie of both your anceſtors hath ſet your <hi>Honors</hi> in, and the praiſes of many ſingular endowments and gifts, in which you doe worthily excell: there are two things wherein your <hi>Honors</hi> daily winne a great increaſe of obſeruance; the one is <hi>pietie</hi> towards God, the other <hi>mercie</hi> towards the poore. The loynes of the poore daily bleſſe your <hi>Honors,</hi> and their mouthes daily pray for you. Your piety is many waies expreſt: to omit many vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proofes of it, your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> hath much confirmed the perſwaſion of your religious diſpoſition by your daily and affectionate reſpect of the word of God and praier in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, ſince the Lord hath made you leſſe able to reſort more frequently to the publike aſſemblies. And <hi>Madam,</hi> what thanks can wee euer ſufficiently giue vnto God for that rare and worthy example, with which your <hi>Ladiſhippe</hi> doth comfort and incourage the hearts of many, in your care of Gods ſabaoths, &amp; in your neuer-failing attendance vpon the ordinances of God, with the congregation, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, not only in your owne perſon, but with your whole familie. For the third, I doe ingenuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe before God and men, that I hold my obligation vnto your <hi>Honors</hi> in the iuſt debt of ſeruice and gratitude to be ſo great, as the labour here imployed is no way anſwerable to a meete diſcharge, no though it had bin taken only for your <hi>Honors</hi> vſe; for to omit the debt which I am in for a great part of my maintenance, and that ſingular incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I reape daily in your Honors reſpect of my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie; what thankes can euer be ſufficient, or what ſeruice

               <hi>THE</hi> ARGVMENT OF this Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are foure principall Parts of this <hi>Epiſtle: 1.</hi> the <hi>Proaeme: 2. Doctrine of Faith: 3. Precepts of life. 4.</hi> the <hi>Epilogue,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. The <hi>Proaeme</hi> is expreſt in the firſt eleuen Verſes of the firſt Chapter: The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith</hi> is expreſt in the reſt of the Verſes of the firſt Chapter, and the whole ſecond Chapter: The <hi>Precepts of life</hi> are ſet downe in the third Chapter, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourth. And the <hi>Epilogue</hi> is in the reſt of the verſes of the fourth Chapter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proaeme</hi> containes two things: Firſt, the <hi>Salutation, verſ. 1, 2.</hi> and ſecondly, a <hi>Preface,</hi> affectionately framed to winne attention and reſpect: wherein he aſſures them of his ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie in remembring them to God, both in Thanks-giuing for their worthy Graces and the meanes thereof, <hi>v. 3.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</hi> and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Prayer for their increaſe and comfortable perſeuerance in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and the eminencie of ſinceritie in holy life, <hi>verſ. 9.10.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> he expreſſeth two waies: first, by Propoſition: ſecondly, by Exhortatiom. In the Propoſition of Doctrine, hee doth with ſingular force of words, and weight of matter ſet out both the worke of our Redemption, <hi>v. 12.13.14.</hi> and the perſon of our Redeemer: and that firſt in his relation to God, <hi>verſe 15.</hi> then in relation to the World, <hi>verſe 15.16.17.</hi> and thirdly, in relation to the Church, both the whole in generall, <hi>verſe 18.19.20.</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> in particular,
<pb facs="tcp:4894:30"/> 
               <hi>verſ. 21.22.</hi> And thus of the Propoſition. Now his Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followes, from the <hi>23.</hi> of <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> to the end of <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> and therin be both perſwades and diſſwades: he perſwades by many ſtrong and moouing Reaſons, to an holy endeauour to continue and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere with all Chriſtian firmeneſſe of reſolution, in the Faith and Hope, was alreadie begotten in them by the Goſpell: and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſeauen laſt Verſes of the firſt Chapter, and the ſeauen firſt Verſes of the ſecond Chapter. Hee diſſwades them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the corrupt Doctrine of the Falſe Apoſtles, whether it were drawne from Philoſophicall Speculations, or from the Traditions of men, or from the Ceremoniall Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes in this order: firſt, hee layes downe the matter of his Dehortation, <hi>Chap. 2. verſe 8.</hi> then ſecondly, hee confirmes it by diuers reaſons, from <hi>verſ. 9.</hi> to <hi>16.</hi> and laſtly, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, and that ſeuerally, as againſt <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Rites, <hi>verſ. 16.17.</hi> againſt Philoſophie, <hi>verſ. 18.19.</hi> and againſt Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>verſe 20.</hi> and ſo to the end of that Chapter.</p>
            <p>Thus of the ſecond part.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of life</note> in giuing <hi>Precepts of life</hi> the Apoſtle holds this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: firſt, hee giues generall Rules, that concerne all as they are Chriſtians: then, hee giues ſpeciall Rules, as they are men of this or that eſtate of life. The generall Rules are contained in the firſt ſeauenteene Verſes of the third Chapter: and the ſpeciall Rules from the eighteenth Verſe of the third Chapter to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Verſe of the fourth. The generall Rules hee reduceth into three heads: <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, the Meditation of heauenly things, <hi>verſ. 1.2.3.4.</hi> ſecondly, the mortification of vices and iniuries, <hi>verſ. 5.</hi> to the <hi>12.</hi> thirdly the exerciſe of holy Graces, a number of which hee reckoneth, both in the kindes, meanes, and ends of them, from <hi>verſ. 12.</hi> to <hi>18.</hi> The particular Rules concerne principally houſhould gouernment: for hee ſets downe the dutie of Wiues, <hi>verſ. 18.</hi> of Husbands, <hi>verſ. 19.</hi> of Children, <hi>verſ. 20.</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>verſ. 21.</hi> of Seruants, <hi>verſ. 22.23.24.25.</hi> and of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>Chap. 4. verſ. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Epilogue,</hi> or Concluſion,<note place="margin">4 The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</note> containes in it both matter of generall Exhortation, as alſo matters of Salutation. The generall Exhortation concernes Prayer, <hi>verſ. 2.3.4.</hi> wiſe Conuerſation,
<pb facs="tcp:4894:31"/> 
               <hi>verſ. 5.</hi> and godly Communication, <hi>verſ. 6.</hi> Now after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath disburdened himſelfe of thoſe generall cares, then hee taketh liberty to refreſh himſelfe and them, by remembring cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that were deare both to him and them. And firſt, hee makes entrance by a narration of his care to know their eſtate, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them of his. To which purpoſe hee ſendeth and praiſeth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicus</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus, verſ. 7.8.9.</hi> The Salutations then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and they are of two ſorts: for ſome are ſignified to them, ſome are required of them. Of the firſt ſort, hee ſignifies the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations of ſix men, three of them Iewes, and three Gentiles, <hi>verſ. 10.11.12.13.14.</hi> The Salutations required, concerne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Laodiceans, verſ. 15.16.</hi> or one of the <hi>Coloſſaean</hi> Preachers, who is not onely ſaluted; but exhorted, <hi>verſ. 17</hi> And then followes the Apoſtles generall Salutations to all, in the laſt Verſe.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> of Doctrine containeth excellent matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Redemption: where hee proceeds in this order: firſt,<note place="margin">

               <p>The worke of our Redemption hee deſcribes two waies, after hee hath touched the firſt efficient cauſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Father: for in the twelfth Verſe hee ſeemes to ſhew, that in reſpect of Inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a <hi>making of vs fit;</hi> and in reſpect of Conſummation, it is a cauſing of vs to enioy an immortall happines in heauen, better then that <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradiſe, or the Iewes in Canaan.

               </p>
               <p>Now, in the end of the thirteenth Verſe hee ſeemes to ſhew that our Redemption ſtands of two parts: firſt, <hi>deliuerance from the power of darkeneſſe:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>tranſlating into the Kingdome of the Sonne of his loue,</hi> one of the many excellent priuiledges of which eſtate, is noted in the fourteenth Verſe, to be <hi>remiſsion of ſinnes, through the bloud of Chriſt.</hi> And thus of the worke of our Redemption.</p>

               <p>Secondly, in relation to the whole World, fiue things are to bee ſaid of CHRIST: firſt, <hi>hee is the firſt begotten of euery Creature,</hi> in the end of the fifteenth Verſe: ſecondly, he is the Creator of all things, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.

                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 18.19.20</note>Thirdly, hee is deſcribed as he ſtands in relation to the Church: and ſo either to the whole Church, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.19.20. or to the Church of the <hi>Coloſsians, verſe</hi> 21.22.</p>
               <p>As he ſtands in relation to the whole Church, hee is ſaid to be <hi>the head of the Church,</hi> in the beginning of the eighteenth Verſe, and this he proues, by ſhewing that he is a head in three reſpects.</p>

               <p>Their miſerie ſtands in two things: firſt, they are <hi>Strangers:</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are <hi>Enemies,</hi> and both are amplified: 1. by the ſubiect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>viz.</hi> not outwardly onely, but in <hi>their mindes:</hi> 2. by the Cauſe, <hi>viz. wicked workes, verſe</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>In ſetting downe their remedie hee notes: 1. the Meanes: 2. the End. The meanes is the <hi>death of the body of Chriſts fleſh:</hi> The end is, that <hi>hee might preſent them holy and vnblameable, and without fault in Gods ſight, verſe</hi> 22.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:4894:33"/>
               <p>In the Exhortation to perſeuerance in faith, there is worthy to be noted: firſt, the manner of propounding it, which is with an <hi>If:</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the dutie required, <hi>Continue:</hi> thirdly, the manner of the dutie, <hi>grounded and ſtabliſhed:</hi> fourthly the obiect, Grace, <hi>in Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Exhortation to perſeuerance in Hope, two things are to be obſerued: firſt, he ſets downe the euill to be auoided, <hi>viz.</hi> vnſetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or reuolting, in the words, <hi>Be not mooued away:</hi> ſecondly, hee quickens them by remembring the cauſe and fountaine of their hope: <hi>viz. The hearing of the Goſpell preached.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus of the Exhortation, the Reaſons follow.</p>
               <p>There are ſeauen Reaſons to inforce this Exhortation to perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The firſt is taken from the conſent of Gods Elect, <hi>Which are through the world,</hi> who haue in the preaching of the Goſpell receiued Faith and Hope, as their common portion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from the teſtimony of PAVL him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and that is two-fold; the firſt is the teſtimonie of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie; This is that hee preacheth, and therefore it ſhould bee that they ſhould keepe faſt: the ſecond is the teſtimonie of his <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> hee hath endured much for the Doctrine of Faith and Hope; and therefore they ſhould continue in it: and to ſtirre them the more concerning his ſufferings, hee ſheweth that hee ſuffered with <hi>great Ioy:</hi> which hee confirmeth by expreſſing the reaſons of his ioy; firſt, becauſe they were <hi>the afflictions of Chriſt;</hi> ſecondly, becauſe hee had his part allotted him by the decree of God; and it was his ioy that hee had almoſt finiſhed what was <hi>left</hi> for him to ſuffer; there was but a little remaining: thirdly, becauſe they were but <hi>in his fleſh:</hi> fourthly, becauſe they were <hi>for them,</hi> and the good of <hi>the Church, Verſe</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is taken from the <hi>teſtimonie of God,</hi> who inioyned vnto PAVL and other Miniſters this <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of the Doctrine of Faith and Hope, with a charge that they ſhould ſee his <hi>Word fulfilled</hi> herein, <hi>Verſe</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon is taken from the excellencie of the Goſpell: which is ſet out; firſt by the nature of it, it <hi>is a myſterie:</hi> ſecondly, by the antiquitie of it, it was, and <hi>was hid ſince the world beganne, from Ages and Generations:</hi> thirdly, by the time of the reuelation of it, <hi>now,</hi> in the new world: fourthly, by the perſons to whom it is reuealed, <hi>viz.</hi> onely <hi>the Saints,</hi> all which ſhould moue to care and conſtancie in keeping of it. <hi>Verſe</hi> 26.</p>

                     <hi>Paul.]</hi> The Apoſtle at his Circumciſion was called <hi>Saul.</hi> For,<note place="margin">The name of the Apoſtle.</note> being of the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> it ſeemes the men of that Tribe did in honour of their King <hi>Saul,</hi> who was the firſt of all the Kings of Iſrael;<note place="margin">Why he was called <hi>Saul.</hi>

                  <p>And not vnfitly did this name light vpon this <hi>Beniamite:</hi> both if we regard him as he was before his calling or after: before his calling, as the olde <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſo did this youngling <hi>Saul</hi> (comming freſhly out of the mint of a Phariſe) perſecute Chriſt, who came of <hi>Dauid.</hi> And after his calling, as it was ſaid of olde <hi>Saul,</hi> by way of Prouerbe, <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> So may it be ſaid of this <hi>Saul,</hi> by way of honour, <hi>Saul is among the Apoſtles:</hi> and that not the leaſt of the Apoſtles, for hee laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly then they all.</p>

                  <p>And this yeelds vs one Reaſon, why a number of prophane men get ſo <label type="milestone">

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſerues to teach all Miniſters and others that are in gouernment, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue by all lawful and holy endeauors the authoritie and credit both of their Perſons and Callings.

                  <p>Laſtly, here may be obſerued, that he that will beare rule ouer other mens <label type="milestone">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Ieſus Chriſt.]</hi> No knowledge can bee auaileable to ſaluation without the knowledge of Chriſt, and therefore the Apoſtle in the very forefront of the Epiſtle, profeſſeth to teach the doctrine of Chriſt, and to ayme at ſuch a courſe of framing of doctrine, as aboue all things Chriſt Ieſus may ſound in his inſtructions, and be receiued into honour, application and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. And he doth in the very entrance intimate what the corrupt teachers muſt looke for from him: <hi>viz.</hi> that hee will batter the whole frame of their building, that haue led men from CHRIST crucified, to vaine Traditions, Philoſophicall ſpeculations, Iewiſh obſeruations, and giuen his glory to Angells.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the will of God.]</hi> That is, by his approbation, direction, protection, but eſpecially by his ſingular vocation. The Apoſtle then holds his calling from God, and therefore beleeues Gods protection and bleſſing becauſe God had called him to his function. And as the Apoſtle, ſo euery member of the Church holds his particular ſtanding and function from God; hee is ranked into order by the ſpeciall prouidence and calling of God.</p>
                  <p>And it is to great purpoſe that men ſhould know it in their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. For firſt, it inforceth diligence: if God haue ſet thee in thy calling,<note place="margin">The aſſurance of a lawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſerues for foure vſes.</note> then it ſtands thee vpon to diſcharge the dueties of thy calling with all heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and painfulneſſe. Secondly, it may teach men not to paſſe the bounds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of their calling; for ſeeing they are in their places by Gods will, they muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> take heede of going beyond their limits, eyther by vſing of vnlawfull wayes and courſes, or by intruding into other mens functions. Thirdly, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth plainely appoint the particular calling to ſerue the generall. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian hath two Callings:<note place="margin">Euery Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath two callings.</note> the one is the externall deſignement of him to ſome outward ſeruice in the Church or Common-wealth, and this is his particular calling: the other is the ſingling of him out by ſpeciall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4894:42"/> ſanctification to glorifie God, and ſeeke his owne ſaluation in the things of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and this is a calling generall to him, with all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. Now it is manifeſt, that Gods commandement is, that men firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God, and the righteouſneſſe thereof. And therefore he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meant that men ſhould ſo follow their outward buſineſſe and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to omit the meanes of knowledge and grace, prayer, reading, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> conference, and ſuch like. Laſtly, the conſideration of this, that wee hold our particular callings from God, ſhould teach vs contentation in the willing vnder-going of the daily moleſtations or troubles and croſſes that do befall vs, and to be content with our kinde of life, ſeeing wee are thus ſet and placed by Gods will.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Obſerue three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, before thou canſt be ingrafted into Chriſt, thou muſt be cut off the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> old tree; eyther <hi>a new man or no man;</hi> eyther loſe the World, or neuer finde Chriſt; eyther diſarme thy ſelfe of all vaine confidence, loue, delight, and ſupport from the world and wordly men, or the arme of the Lord will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beare thee vp and nouriſh thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a true Member is not but by <hi>generation</hi> in nature, nor canſt thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be a true member of Chriſt but by <hi>regeneration:</hi> great oddes between a wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den legge, though neuer ſo exquiſitely made, and a true legge; all members in Creation be <hi>begotten,</hi> and in Grace <hi>begotten againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as they are not Man and Wife, where there is no ſure making by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Contract or Marriage going before; ſo neyther can any be in Chriſt, vnleſſe hee be receiued vnto the Couenant of Grace: and, as it is a mad thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for any woman to ſay; Such a man is my Husband, for hee is a kinde man, and did caſt his eye vpon mee, or did me a pleaſure at ſuch a time, &amp;c. So, it is as great ſpirituall madneſſe for any Soule to plead intereſt in Chriſt, when they can alleadge no more but his generall loue to man; or that hee offered Grace to vs in the Word and Sacraments, or that wee together with the Goſpell receiued outward bleſſings, or ſuch like; when men can ſhew no contract, no mutuall entercourſe betweene CHRIST, and the SOVLE, no manner of euidence for their hopes, no witneſſes from the Word, Spirit, or Children of God, for their ſpitituall Marriage.</p>
                  <p>Againe, would a man know whether hee bee in Chriſt?<note place="margin">Who are in Chriſt.</note> theſe Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons likewiſe reſolue his doubt, by a three-fold Anſwere: firſt, hee is in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4894:46"/> Chriſt, if he bloſſome, grow, and beare fruit, euen ſuch <hi>fruit</hi> as is to <hi>eternall life.</hi> If a man bee abundant in the workes of the Lord; and grow in ſuch graces as are communicated onely to the faithfull, hee is certainely a true Plant in this Stocke: for, by growing and fruit, is the Plant that is ingrafted knowne from the ſprigge that is lopped off, and lyeth by, and is withered. A life barren and void of the workes of Pietie and Mercy, is a manifeſt ſigne that the perſon is not in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if there be in our ſoules the ſenſe, and feeling, and motion of ſpirituall life, then are wee members: for, in a wodden legge is there no ſenſe nor naturall motion. When men haue as much ſenſe and feeling, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and delight in the things of the Spirit, as the Word, Prayer, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Goſpell, with the exerciſes of holy Graces in the duties of Gods worſhip, or things otherwiſe belonging to the Kingdome of Chriſt, as the carnall man hath in the profits,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Romanes</hi> 8.</note> pleaſures, and fleſhly things of this world: Theſe certainely are men <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> and by the Spirit myſtically vnited to Chriſt the head: and on the other ſide, a more plaine and palpable ſigne cannot be giuen to proue demonſtratiuely, that a man is not in Chriſt, then when a man findes no taſte, hath no feeling, can take no delight in ſpirituall Meanes, Graces, or Perſons, and yet is eaſily affected with the leaſt profits and delights of the world.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it will appeare by the holy communion betweene Chriſt and the faithfull Soule, by his co-habitation and ſpirituall entercourſe, when Chriſt meetes a Chriſtian with holy Comforts, with heauenly refreſhings, with ſacred anſweres, with ſpirituall direction, and other ſacred ſignes of the preſence of Chriſt, in the vſe of the meanes, ſporting himſelfe with the Chriſtian Soule: this entercourſe I ſay, this ſecret and chamber-meeting, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> theſe inward and hearty feelings, wrought by the Worde and Sacraments, by Prayer, and Faſting, by Reading and Conference, are certaine and ſure ſignes and ſeales to prooue a marriage going before.

                  <p>The meaning being thus found: I conſider the obſeruations firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that the Apoſtle doth in the very Salutation ſow the ſeedes of the whole Goſpell, we might learne euen in our ordinary imployments, to mind Gods glory and the ſaluation of others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Three reaſons why children may be taught the principles they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</note> we may hence ſee that it is lawfull to draw <hi>abridgements</hi> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and commend them to ordinary vſe: as here theſe graces to an ordinary ſalutation from man to man; and ſo I thinke of teaching the Lords Prayer and Commandements, with other Scripture, to children or ſeruants, that yet vnderſtand not, and that for ſuch reaſons as theſe: firſt, that ſo they might haue occaſion much to thinke of the things are ſo much and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vrged: ſecondly, that if any time of extremitie ſhould come, they might haue certaine ſeedes of direction and comfort, to guide and ſupport them: thirdly, that their condemnation might be more iuſt, if hauing <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and other principles of Catechiſme ſo much in their mouths, they ſhould not get them into their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a queſtion may here be moued:<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how the Apoſtle can here in theſe words wiſh vnto them their chiefe good or felicitie, ſeeing theſe are not all the graces or bleſſings needfull to our happineſſe?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> I might anſwere this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly. 1.

                  <p>But the maine <hi>Doctrine</hi> which generally I obſerue out of theſe words,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> is this; that ſpirituall things from God in Chriſt are the beſt things,<note place="margin">Spirituall things are the beſt things.</note> and moſt to be ſought, and deſired, and wiſhed, both for our ſelues and others.

Verſe: in which the end and drift of the Apoſtle is, to winne affection to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine afterwards to be propounded: and this he doth by ſhewing his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great loue to them, which he demonſtrates by two things which hee did for them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> he both gaue thankes vnto God in their behalfe, and alſo made many a prayer for them: which ſpirituall duties are better kindneſſes and ſignes of true affection and reſpect, then all ciuill curteſies or outward complements are or can be.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things in the Preface are firſt generally ſet downe in this Verſe, and then particularly enlarged in the Verſes afterwards: firſt, the Thankſgiuing, from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to the 9.

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rſt, hee giues thankes: Secondly, he prayes. In the Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing conſider, firſt, what hee doth, in theſe words, <hi>Wee giue thankes:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to whom he doth it, in theſe words; <hi>To God, euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus farre of the order of the words.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines follow, which muſt bee conſidered generally from the whole Verſe, and ſpecially from the ſeuerall words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Two generall Doctrines.</note>The firſt generall Doctrine is this, that it is not enough to ſalute others kindly, but we muſt doe and performe the ſound duties of loue: this is from the coherence, and condemnes the ſinfull barrenneſſe of many that know a neceſſity of no duties of loue, vnleſſe it be to ſalute curteouſly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee ſee heere that Tyrants may take away the benefit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, reading, conference, and ſuch like; but they cannot hinder vs of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Paul</hi> can pray and giue thankes in priſon, for himſelfe and others, as well as euer before. Let wicked men doe their worſt, Gods children will ſtill pray vnto God And looke how many promiſes are made in Scripture, to the prayers of the Saints, ſo many conſolations are inuiolably preſerued vnto them, againſt the rage of whatſoeuer extremitie wicked men can caſt vpon them: this is a ſingular comfort.</p>

The Apoſtle that in more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times iarred with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> can now hold peace and firme vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with meaner men; and therefore he ſaith <hi>Wee,</hi> not <hi>I.</hi> And thus wee ſee it was in the times of perſecution in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, the Biſhoppes and Paſtors that could not agree when they were in their Seates and Pulpits, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſeeke agreement when they are in priſon, and muſt come to the Stake. And ſo it many times falls out in common Iudgements, as the ſword and peſtilence:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 24.2.</note> in ſuch times the words of the Prophet are fulfilled, <hi>Like People like Prieſts, like Seruant like Maſter, like Buyer like Seller, like Borrower like Lender, like Giuer like Taker to vſury.</hi> Great and preuailing Iudgements take away all that vanity of conceit and ſwelling of pride, which difference of gifts and places bred before.</p>
                  <p>The Lord for his mercies ſake grant, that at the length there may be found ſome remedie to cure the wound and heale the breach which proud conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath made, and continued, with effects prodigious and vnheard of: leſt the Lord be at length prouoked to plague with more fierce and cruell Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and worke vnion, at leaſt in one furnace of common calamitie: the ſame God, for his Sonnes ſake, worke in all that any wiſe loue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of Ieruſalem, on all ſides, that they more regard the glory of God and the good of the Church, then their owne greatneſſe either of place or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4894:48"/> reſpects amongſt men, and that they may more ſeeke the truth then victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And as for thoſe that neither loue the truth nor peace, the Lord open their eyes and conuert them, or elſe giue them to eate of the fruite of their owne wayes.</p>

Firſt, to aſſure them of his loue, and that he did it not of malice, a thing eſpecially <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> to be looked to in all admonitions, in familie, or elſe-where, as well to praiſe for vertue, as diſpraiſe for vice. Secondly, hee holds this courſe to let them <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>2</label> ſee that he did account them as Chriſtians, though they had their infirmities.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>3</label> might the more hate ſinne, ſeeing it did darken their graces, which elſe would more appeare.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>4</label> mercies to vs, and we neuer praiſe God our ſelues. Laſtly, it carrieth with it <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>5</label> a ſecret taxation of vnthankfulneſſe, as the cauſe of their fall: for, had they beene more thankfull for the ſinceritie of the preaching of the Goſpell, and for the <hi>riches of the grace of Chriſt</hi> offered, the honourable opinion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and ſufficiencie thereof, to giue all ſound contentment, would haue preſerued them from mixing the worſhip of God with <hi>mens traditions,</hi> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting contrary doctrine, and from diſhonouring the mediation of Chriſt with <hi>Angell-worſhip.</hi> Then did Popiſh traditions ouerflow, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were contemned, and the light of them ſuppreſſed: and in generall, an vnthankfull man is euer a vicious man.</p>
                  <p>More ſpecially, in the dutie here mentioned two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>

                     <hi>We giue thankes] Euchariſt</hi> is ſometimes appropriated onely to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, but moſt commonly is generall to all holy thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, eſpecially to God.</p>
                  <p>There is a flattering thankefulneſſe to men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 24.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.</note> and a Phariſaicall proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited thankeſgiuing to God.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſpirituall mans thankefulneſſe to God, I propound three things onely in the generall briefly to be noted: Firſt, Reaſons to incite vs to the practiſe of continuall thankefulneſſe to God. Secondly, for what things we are to be thankfull. Thirdly, what rules to bee obſerued for the manner of performance of it.</p>
                  <p>There are many reaſons ſcattered in Scripture,<note place="margin">Motiues to thankfulneſſe.</note> to incite vs to Thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: firſt, becauſe it is a ſpeciall part of Gods worſhip, or one way by which we yeeld worſhip to God. Hence,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16.</note> that the Apoſtle accounts it a great loſſe, if <hi>the people cannot ſay Amen,</hi> when the Teacher <hi>bleſſeth in the ſpirit, or giueth thankes.</hi> Againe, when he would exhort them to liberality, hee vrgeth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4894:49"/> them with this reaſon, that the <hi>ſupplying of the neceſſities of the Saints would cauſe much thankeſgiuing to God,</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 9.12.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.2.</note>. And in the 4. of the 2. of <hi>Corin.</hi> he ſheweth that <hi>the thankeſgiuing of many would breed both a plenty of grace, and an abounding of much praiſe to God.</hi> Secondly, the Apoſtle hauing dehorted the <hi>Epheſians</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Couetouſneſſe, Filthineſſe, Ieſting,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh Talking;</hi> hee addeth, but rather <hi>vſe giuing of Thanks</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 43.4.</note>. As if hee would note, that thankefulneſſe for Gods Bleſſings and Graces duely performed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> would preſerue them from the filth and power of theſe baſe vices. Beſides, it is a thing that <hi>becommeth the Saints,</hi> nothing better. Thirdly, it is a ſigne of three worthy things, wherein it behooueth euery man to be well aſſured: firſt, it is a ſigne of a heart that hath rightly receiued Chriſt, and is firmely <hi>rooted, built,</hi> and <hi>ſtabliſhed in the Faith</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6.7.</note>. Secondly, if <hi>men in all things let their requeſts be ſhewed vnto God with giuings of thankes,</hi> it is a ſigne of the <hi>peace of God,</hi> euen <hi>that the peace of God that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, will preſerue their hearts and mindes in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.</note>. Secondly, in aduerſitie as well as in proſperitie, and that in all ſorts of afflictions; in danger<note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 27:35</note>, in wrongs. Thirdly, in outward things wee muſt bee thankefull<note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 3.</note>, not onely for great things done, for our ſtates or names, but euen for the leſſer and more daily fauours, as for our foode, and the creatures for our nouriſhment. And in ſpeciall manner haue the Saints in all ages bound themſelues to a ſet courſe of prayer and praiſe ouer and for their food: and therefore their groſſe ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh prophaneneſſe is ſo much the greater, that ſit downe and riſe from their meate,<note place="margin">Scripture for prayer and Thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for our very food.</note> like brute beaſts, without any Prayer or Thankeſgiuing. If any aske whether there be any expreſſe Scripture for Grace before and after meate, I anſwere, there is, and alledge theſe three vndeniable and plaine places of Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.4. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the manner of Thankeſgiuing, it may bee found in that phraſe vſed by the Prophets in the olde Teſtament of <hi>Sacrificing the calues of their lips</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>vlt. Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.</note>.<note place="margin">The manner of Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note> For heere foure things may be obſerued. Firſt; it muſt be a dead Calfe, to note that all Thankeſgiuing muſt proceed from humble and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified minds; and therefore the Phariſies thanks did not a whit <hi>iuſtifie</hi> them<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 18:11.14.</note>. Secondly, it muſt be a ſacrificed Calfe. Now, in the Sacrifice three things were required; an <hi>Altar, Fire,</hi> and <hi>to lay the hand vpon the head of the Beaſt:</hi> An <hi>Altar,</hi> for not onely our prayers muſt be made in the name of Chriſt, but our prayſes alſo muſt be tendered to God in his mediation, or they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be accepted, no more then a Calfe not laid on the Altar: neyther is it enough to lay the Calfe on the Altar, but <hi>Fire</hi> muſt be put to it: to note, that the bare throwing out of words of thankefulneſſe, though in the name of Chriſt, will not ſerue, vnleſſe wee doe alſo get ſome feeling ardencie and zeale to burne the Sacrifice. Thirdly, we muſt <hi>lay our hands on the head of the Calfe;</hi> that is, in all humilitie wee muſt confeſſe our vnworthineſſe of all the bleſſiings or graces wee giue thankes for. Againe, in that they offer a Calfe, it ſignifieth that wee ſhould not offer our thankefulneſſe to God of that that coſts vs nothing: wee ſhould deſire to expreſſe our praiſe by doing ſome thing to further Gods worſhip, or relieue the neceſſities of others. If GOD bleſſe vs at home, wee ſhould carry a Calfe to the Temple. Laſtly, we muſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4894:49"/> not ſacrifice to a <hi>ſtrange God,</hi> when we giue thankes, and that men doe when <hi>they ſacrifice to their nets,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh, that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16.</note> when men attribute the glory and praiſe of God to the meanes or ſecond cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus of thankfulneſſe in the generall.</p>
                  <p>But that which is here entended, is,<note place="margin">We muſt giue thankes for others. Foure rules of triall.</note> that we ſhould giue thankes for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as for our ſelues, which is not a curteſie but a dutie. This du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of praiſing God for others, growes exceeding commendable, if wee can exerciſe it in theſe particulars. Firſt, if wee can giue thankes for thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings vpon others, which the world accounts ſhamefull to enioy, as Zeale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for Gods glory, religious Sinceritie, and vprightneſſe of heart, the Croſſe for Chriſt his ſake, and ſuch like. Secondly, if wee can <hi>firſt</hi> giue thankes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that is, be more apt to praiſe God for the vertues of others, then be forwards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to taxe their faults and frailties. Thirdly, if we can doe it for <hi>all</hi> ſorts of <hi>men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</note> euen our enemies. Fourthly,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.9.</note> if wee can bee <hi>thankefull</hi> for the true <hi>ioy</hi> wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> haue had in other mens proſperities.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point, if wee would haue others to giue thankes for vs,<note place="margin">As any are more heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, they are more frequent in praiſes.</note> we ſhould labour to be ſuch, as for whom thankes may be giuen. And thus of what they doe: Now, to whom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To God.]</hi> Theſe words hauing beene vſed in the very Verſe before, teach vs two things. Firſt, that it is no cloying to a ſanctified minde to be much and often, yea, vpon euery occaſion in the honourable mention and lauding of God, aſcribing in euery thing glory to God: ſo, in heauen they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be weary of Gods praiſes, no not vnto all eternitie. And certaine it is, that the more men grow in ſanctification, the more eaſie and apt are their hearts to entertaine all occaſions of communion with God, without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or deadneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>(to God)</hi> ſhuts out the praiſes of themſelues or of men. It is fit our reioycing and praiſe ſhould be directed thither from whence the bleſſing came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Father]</hi> Theſe words are conſidered in the former Verſe. Thus much of his Thankeſgiuing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Praying for you]</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">A childe of God neuer giues thankes but he hath cauſe to pray, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</note> in generall from the ioyning together of theſe two duties, two things may be obſerued: Firſt, that a childe of God neuer giues thankes but he hath cauſe to pray: for, if it be for temporall things, hee muſt pray both for their ſanctified vſe, that they become not occaſions of ſinne; and for their preſeruation according to Gods will: if it be for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, he hath reaſon to pray for increaſe, ſtrength, and preſeruation againſt falling, and ſuch like. Secondly, on the other ſide, I ſay alſo, that a childe of God doth neuer pray, but hee may finde reaſons to giue thankes, wee may finde mercies in any miſerie; yea, it is a ſingular mercy to haue a heart to pray, and to haue ſo many large promiſes made to them that call vp on God in their diſtreſſe. But the maine particular <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, that we ought not onely to pray for our ſelues but for others. And the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. ſeemes to make foure ſorts of prayers for others, <hi>viz. Deprecations, Requeſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Foure ſorts of prayers for others.</note> 
                     <hi>Interceſſions,</hi> and <hi>Giuing of Thankes: Deprecations</hi> are Prayers for help againſt hurtfull things; <hi>Requeſts</hi> are Prayers for profitable things; the word rendered <hi>Interceſſions,</hi> is by ſome taken to ſignifie complaints vnto God againſt ſuch as wrong them, for whom we pray: or elſe, it is a more ſet or ſerious implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods aide with the vnited forces of the godly: and laſtly, <hi>Giuing of Thankes</hi> ſtands in the lauding of God for bleſſings or graces: and in the 6. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and in the 1 of <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. the Apoſtle ſets downe rules to bee obſerued in Praier for others: in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> hee requires that they pray,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alwaies.]</hi> To pray alwaies, is to conſecrate euery day and night to God by Prayer: and beſides, to pray vpon all occaſions, with lifting vp our harts vnto God; or by vſing ſhort prayers, which they haue beene wont to call <hi>Eiaculations.</hi> Neither was it the dutie of <hi>Paul</hi> onely, to pray alwaies, that is, to keepe a ſet order of Prayers; but it is our dutie alſo to ſet apart time euery day,<note place="margin">Reaſons to warrant pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery day.</note> euening and morning, to pray vnto God our ſelues, and our houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds. And becauſe theſe exerciſes of Religion are by the moſt wholy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and in roome of it, vile prophaneneſſe ſtaines mens houſes, I will here ſet downe, by the way, ſome few reaſons to warrant a daily ſet courſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of praying.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 6.11.</note> Firſt, our Sauiour CHRIST teacheth vs to pray for <hi>the bread of the day, euery day:</hi> as God will not promiſe vs bread for a weeke, a month, a yeere; ſo neither will God accept of a prayer for the neceſſities of a weeke, month or yeere before hand, but will haue vs to make as much conſcience to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> pray daily, as we haue ſenſe of daily wants. Secondly, we are commanded to <hi>pray continually:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17.</note> now, what ſenſe can be probably giuen of theſe words, if that a daily ſet courſe of prayer bee not included. Thirdly, the Saints <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> prayed euery day, an auncient practiſe ſome thouſand of yeeres a goe; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> prayed <hi>ſeauen times a day;</hi> and <hi>Daniell, three times a day.</hi> Let wicked and prophane people ſay, what needes all this prayer; but let vs be aſſured, that as holineſſe and grace growes in any, ſo are they more abundant in this worſhip of praier: the holieſt men haue euer prayed moſt: for though they haue not moſt neede, yet they haue alwaies moſt ſenſe of their owne needes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and others to. Fourthly, if our foode muſt bee euery day ſanctified by the exerciſe of the Word and Prayer, then much more haue wee neede to ſanctifie our ſelues,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.2.</note> our houſholds, our callings, and our labours by daily Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Prayer is called <hi>Incenſe</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Now the Iewes held it an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of deſolation,</hi>

                  <p>That the nature of this grace may appeare, the ſeuerall acceptations of the word, the ſorts, obiects, parts and degrees of it muſt be conſidered. <hi>Faith</hi> is in Scriptures diuerſly taken: ſometimes it is giuen to GOD,<note place="margin">The accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word <hi>Faith.</hi>

Here may bee iuſtly taxed the groſſe ouer-ſight and ſecuritie of many, (otherwiſe the deare Seruants of God) that are no better acquainted with the <hi>promiſes of life,</hi> vpon the truth of which depends their happineſſe, and both preſent and future comfort. And laſtly, by the ſame Faith, whereby the iuſt are ſaued, by the ſelfe ſame they liue in the courſe of life in this world: the ground of his Faith for his preſeruation, is the prouidence of his God, whiles the men of this world wonderfully pleaſe themſelues in ſacrificing to their nets, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in their affections, the ſtay of their maintenance, vnto their labour, friends, inheritance, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, how miſerable is our life here many times in reſpect of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with which Sathan doth fire vs?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16.</note> Now if there were in vs conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect of certaine application of Gods fauour, there is a ſecret power in Faith, <hi>as a Sheild,</hi> not onely to keepe off, but extinguiſh <hi>the fiery darts of the Diuell.</hi> And the true reaſon why our life is continually aſſaulted, and why the world lieth vanquiſhed vnder a thouſand miſeries, is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men doe not labour for a particular aſſurance of GODS loue in Chriſt, which being once had, wee ſhould ſoone ſee an happy <hi>victorie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the World,</hi> Hell, and Death, in reſpect of the beginnings of many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly contentments.</p>
                  <p>In the third place we are to conſider the benefits which the weakeſt Faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> obtaineth: and they are eſpecially ſixe.</p>

                  <p>Miniſters are guilty of the want of Faith in their Hearers: Firſt, when they teach not at all, becauſe <hi>Faith cannot be had without hearing.</hi> Secondly, if wee <hi>teach not Faith,</hi> and that plainely; if they intend not the chiefeſt part of their labours to informe men in the doctrine of Faith (vnder which is contained the whole doctrine of the Sinners conuerſion with his God) though they informe manners both for Pietie and Righteouſneſſe, and buſie themſelues in other contemplatiue Diuinitie, yet haue they not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Calling, but are wofull hinderances of Faith in the hearers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lets in the People.</note>Secondly, in the People Faith is letted three wayes:

                        <item>1 <hi>By errors in their Iudgements.</hi>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are fiue eſpeciall <hi>Errors,</hi> with any of which whoſoeuer is infected Faith is letted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when men thinke they are bound to follow their Callings, and to mind their worldly imployments; and therfore cannot ſpend the time about thinking of Sermons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16.</note> &amp;c. Our Sauiour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16. in the Parable, ſhowes, that though men giue Heauen faire words, yet they take not a courſe to get it: but what lets them? Is it Whoredome, Drunkennes, Idolatry, Murther, breach of Sabbath, &amp;c. No ſuch matter, but onely the abuſe of lawfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and pleaſures. What more lawfull then a Farme? what more honourable of all pleaſures then Marriage? onely obſerue that the voluptuous perſon ſaith flatly, <hi>He cannot come:</hi> and the worldly man, <hi>I pray you haue me excuſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:4894:54"/>
                  <p>Secondly, a ſecond <hi>Error</hi> letting Faith, is a cloſe opinion of merit, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtickes faſt in our nature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith is hindered, when the minde is fore-ſtalled with an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.</note> that an outward ſeruing of God will ſerue to bring them neere enough to God. If they heare Seruice and Sermons, and receiue the Sacraments &amp;c. they haue done ſo much as they thinke is enough.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, many therefore neuer labour to get Faith, becauſe they thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is impoſſible to take any ſuch courſe, that they ſhould get any aſſurance of the remiſſion of their ſinnes in this life, or if it be poſſible for others, yet it is not for them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, others thinke it poſſible to be had, and it is good to bee humbled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſo farre as to ſeeke it with teares and prayers; and they thinke they doe well that will not giue ouer, till they haue comfort that way, but yet they thinke all this adoe vnneceſſary, and that they may be ſaued without it.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Heart</hi> Faith is letted fiue wayes.<note place="margin">Lets in the heart.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, when men nouriſh the ſecret euills of their hearts, both in thoughts and affections, and make not conſcience to repent for them. An euill heart is alwaies an vnfaithfull heart;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.13.</note> therefore men are exhorted to <hi>take heede of being hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Wordlines</hi> is a great let of Faith, when men ſuffer their thoughts and affections to be continually taken vp with minding of things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, though they cannot be charged with any great couetouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is in mens affections an <hi>vnwillingneſſe</hi> to part with worldly pleaſures and delights, and they are loath to looſe their credit with their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall friends, which they ſay they muſt doe if they take this courſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the world is full of <hi>common hope</hi> and preſumption of Gods mercy: men ſay, God is mercifull, when they haue neither comfort from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, nor ground of aſſurance, nor witneſſe of the ſpirit of adoption.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Faith is letted, and men are kept from vſing the meanes to get Faith, and to ſeeke God while hee may be found, onely through a <hi>feare</hi> leaſt if they ſhould examine themſelues, and ſearch whether they had a true faith or not, they ſhould finde they had none, and then they ſhould be troubled, and driuen into Melancholy deſpaire, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Lets in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation.</note> there are ſome things in mens carriage which greatly let and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>a prophane contempt of the word of God,</hi> either men will not heare, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but by ſtarts, or they attend not, or not apply it to themſelues, or not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of the doctrine afterwards, or not labour for the power of it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the example of the multitude</hi> hinders much<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 7.13.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.23.24</note>, eſpecially the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of wiſe men and great men in the world<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 7.45. <hi>to</hi> 50.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome when they go about the duties of mortification and Faith, they are turned off before they get Faith; either becauſe they finde hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, or are ouer charged with temptations or doubts of audience and acceptance, and that God will neuer looke after ſuch broken deſires, &amp;c. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or elſe becauſe they haue not comfort preſently, they grow deſperate and ſay they ſhall haue none at all, or elſe are vanquiſhed with thoughts of Atheiſme iniected, which many times preuailes ſo ſtrongly, that they can hardly bee recouered againe to any care to labour for Faith, till either bitter croſſes or feare of Death or Hell awaken them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Cloſeneſſe</hi> is a great cauſe of want of Faith, when people will not diſcouer their doubts and feares, eſpecially to their Paſtors being wiſe and mercifull, and yet know not what to doe, and cannot get information from publike hearing. Here may be taken vp a iuſt complaint of the ſtrangeneſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4894:55"/> betweene the Shepheards and the Flockes: the one thinking hee hath done enough if he preach to them, and the other if they heare him.</p>
                  <p>There remaines two Vſes of this Doctrine of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note>Firſt, ſeeing there are diuers ſorts of Faith, and that many benefits may be had by a true Faith, and ſeeing that on the other ſide, there are wofull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the want of Faith, &amp;c. It ſhould teach vs to try whether wee haue Faith or no: and that this may be knowne, we muſt vnderſtand;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that before Faith can be wrought, the heart muſt bee mollified by afflictions,<note place="margin">The ſignes of Faith.</note> by the continuall dropping of the word of God, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our miſerie, by Legall feare, or laſtly, by terrors from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, before Faith can appeare, Repentance will ſhew it ſelfe, and that eſpecially in two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt in godly Sorrow for ſinne paſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the change of the thoughts, affections and life.</p>
                  <p>As for godly Sorrow, it may not be denied, but that it may be without ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in ſome, but neuer ſo eaſie in any, but theſe three things are true: 1. That they grieue becauſe they cannot grieue. 2. They hate their ſpeciall ſinnes. 3. They reforme both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith, after the ſoftning of the heart and Repentance, ſhewes it ſelfe in ſixe things: Firſt, in an honourable opinion ready <hi>to belieue all the word of God,</hi> though it make neuer ſo much againſt our pleaſure or profit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the <hi>Combate</hi> betweene the fleſh and ſpirit. Thirdly, by the <hi>holy Deſires</hi> after remiſſion of ſinnes, and holineſſe of life, witneſſed by conſtant Prayers, and diligent Vſe of the meanes. Fourthly, by a fixed <hi>Reſolution,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon the way of God, though they finde not comfort preſently. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the forſaking of the world, and pleaſures of ſinne<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb:</hi> 11:25.</note>. Laſtly, by the purging out of the euills of the thoughts and affections<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Math:</hi> 5.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</note>. As for Ioy, Peace, Thankefulneſſe, Admiration, Loue, and deſire to conuert others, &amp;c. they belong to Faith growne, not ſo apparantly to Faith begunne.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> Laſtly, here might iuſtly be taxed the defects and wants that are found in the common Proteſtant.<note place="margin">The defects of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Faith.</note> The Faith of the Proteſtant at large, is faultie: Firſt, becauſe hee knowes no time of ſpirituall birth, and yet he can tell to a day when he was borne in nature. Secondly, they ſeeke not vnto the meanes ſpirituall to get Faith. Thirdly, they reſt in other things in ſtead of Faith, as Knowledge, Hope, &amp;c. Fourthly, their Faith is commonly either Hiſtoricall or Temporarie; for either it is enough to beleeue that Chriſt died for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or elſe if they beleeue the Articles of the Creede to be true, and bee no Papiſts, but ſound in the matter of Iuſtification, and receiue the Sacrament, eſpecially when they are ſicke, all is well, or if they beleeue the word of God to be true, or eſpecially if they can be willing to heare Sermons, &amp;c. Fiftly, they regard not Gods promiſes to apply them, nor to liue by Faith, they hold both to be abſurd. Sixtly, they want the iudgement that Diuines call <hi>the iudgement of goodneſſe.</hi> Laſtly, they doe not beleeue that application is of the nature of Faith.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God doth not ordinarily giue ſauing Grace, but it is gotten in or after ſome great affliction. A man may get much generall knowledge, and goe farre in a temporary Faith, without any great paine or perplexitie, but the paines of trauaile do vſually accompany the birth of any ſauing Grace.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4894:55"/> Neyther is there any ſuch hearkening after a childe borne in nature, as there is after an afflicted conſcience now ready to bee deliuered of any eternall Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Grace cannot be receiued but it workes a great change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <label type="milestone">

And this Commandement he calls a new Commandement, not in reſpect of the matter of the duty; for that was alwaies required, but in reſpect of the forme of obſeruing it; for the old generall rule was, <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe:</hi> but now that forme <hi>(as I haue loued you)</hi> hath in it ſomthing that is more expreſſe, and for the incomparable ſufficiencie of the preſident, is matchleſſe, and more full of incitations to fire affection.

                  <p>The third Motiue may be taken from the <hi>benefites</hi> that may be gotten by loue: and theſe are diuers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is <hi>much comfort in loue:</hi> the Lord doth vſually and graciouſly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> water the ſociety, conferences,<note place="margin">From profit. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.1.</note> prayers and other duties performed mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Saints, with the deaws of many ſweet and glorious refreſhings, by which they are daily excited, inflamed, and incouraged to a holy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in godlineſſe.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, by the vſuall ſinnes which are riſe amongſt them, euen ſuch as bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fortreſſe of Loue. How can they pleaſe themſelues in their charitie, if we conſider how Malice, Reuenge, Anger, Slandering, Back-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Tradeſ-man while hee is riſing is ſo fleſhed with ſucceſſe, and ſtuffed with the greedy deſire of profit, that hee cares not whom hee wrongs, nor how much hee becomes preiudiciall to other mens trade: But this man is not ſo filled with Selfe-loue, but the declining Tradeſ-man that hath ouer-liued his prime, is euery way as well filled with Enuy. And thus men are not in charitie neither full nor faſting.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it appeares to be defectiue in the <hi>Obiects</hi> of Loue, in a chiefe <hi>Companion</hi> of Loue, in the <hi>Parts</hi> of Loue, and in the <hi>Manner</hi> of louing.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: the onely men that are chiefly to be loued, and our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſpent vpon, are the Saints; that is, ſuch religious perſons as make conſcience of all their wayes: but are theſe the men the common Proteſtant loues? Oh times! oh manners! what men finde worſe entertainment in the world then theſe? Is not the leaſt endeauour after holineſſe chaſed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with open hates, diſlikes, ſlanders? Can a man refraine himſelfe from euill, and not be made a prey? Doth there any liue godly, and they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him not? Away falſe wretch: ſaiſt thou, thou art in charitie with all men, and yet canſt not beare the Image of God in a childe of God?</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond: all true Loue ought to be accompanied with Faith; yea, it ought to be founded vpon Faith: and therefore herein is the common loue of the world defectiue, that a communion with men is not firſt ſanctified by vnion with God. Theſe men that boaſt ſo much of their charitie neuer made conſcience of ſeeking the aſſurance of Gods fauour in Chriſt, neither euer trauailed vnder the burthen of their ſinnes, ſo as to ſeeke forgiueneſſe as the true bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the common Proteſtant is exceedingly to blame in the very maine duties of Loue; no tenderneſſe of heart, no true Hoſpitalitie, and for mercy to the poore the olde complaints may be taken vp,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.1. <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.1.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no mercie in the Land: Mercifull men are taken away.</hi> Wee may now adaies waite for ſome Samaritane to come and proue himſelfe a neighbour: and for ſocietie and fellowſhip in the Goſpell with Gods people, it will neuer ſinke into the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe carnall men, that that is any way expedient: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in all the branches of Clemency before expreſſed, where is the man that makes conſcience of them?</p>
                  <p>And for the laſt, it is eaſily auouched, that the Loue that is found in the moſt men, is neither brotherly nor without groſſe fayning and hypocriſie, nor proceedeth it from a heart in any meaſure purified; and laſtly, it is ſo farre from being feruent, that it is ſtone colde.</p>

                  <p>There is an admirable Wiſedome and Mercy of God, in the very maner of diſpenſing of his Graces; for hee makes one Grace crowne another, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſeruat. </seg>1</label> become a recompence and reward to another: as here for Hopes ſake Gods Children breake through the difficulties of Faith,<note place="margin">One Grace crowneth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> and the impediments and diſcouragements of Loue. When God ſees how many waies the heart of man is beſet in the ſpirituall combat, about the getting and exerciſe of thoſe two Graces, hee is pleaſed by his word and ſpirit to trumpet out victorie by ſhewing the glory of heauen, and to ſet on the Crowne of Hope, as the aſſured pledge of full and finall victorie: it is Hope that pluckes vp the heart of man to a conſtant deſire of vnion with God by Faith, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with man by Loue. And the true reaſon why ſo many men vtterly neglect the care to get a iuſtifying Faith, and an inflamed affection to Gods Children, is, becauſe they haue no taſte of the comforts of the euidence of a better life by Hope.</p>

                  <p>The firſt thing in ſpeciall, is the kinde of ordinance in which the word was effectuall, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Hearing.</p>

How doe the thouſands euen in Iſraell, periſh through the failing or wanting of Viſion? Is there not almoſt millions of Men and Women that haue ſcarce heard (by preaching) whether there be any holy Ghoſt? Oh the cruell torments that abide thoſe <hi>ſoule-murtherers!</hi> Shall I name them? I wiſh their repentance, that ſo they might haue a <hi>new name;</hi> but becauſe lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience ſhewes that <hi>the vnſauory Salt</hi> ſeldome findes wherewith it may be ſalted; therefore it is the dutie of all Gods people to bowe the knees of their hearts to God, beſeeching him to inflame the hearts of thoſe that are in authoritie, with ſuch bowels of compaſſion, that they would in due time purge the Church of them, that ſo their names may no more bee heard amongſt vs. Whiles men lie ſicke of the ſpirituall Lethargy in their owne hearts, they are little troubled with the diſtreſſe of others, but if men would euen in Gods ſight duely waigh, without ſhifting and preiudice, theſe propoſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the hearing of the Word is the ordinarie meanes to conuert mens ſoules to God,</hi> Rom. 10.14. 1 Pet. 1.23. &amp;c.

Thirdly, for the reproofe of the diſorders and vitious diſpoſitions of men in the hearing of the Word. Many are the ſorts of euill hearers: exceeding many are the wicked humours of men, by which they ſinne againſt the Word heard: the Scripture hath noted and taxed diuers corruptions in men, in hearing, and fearefully threatned them. For the better explication of this vſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things; Firſt, the ſorts of euill hearers: Secondly, their ſtate in reſpect of it.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 15 12.</note>: Men are ſo wedded to their owne conceits, and ſtuffed with preiudice, that they many times wilfully ſtudy, and ſtriue to frame ſcandale and offence out of the words of the Teacher.

                        <hi>Heb:</hi> 12:19.</note>. Ninthly, Some (like the chiefe Prieſts and Phariſes) when they perceiue that the Preacher rebukes their ſinnes, ſeeke to lay hands vpon him<note n="o" place="margin">

                  <p>The ciuiller ſorts of hearers are diuerſly ſinnefull in their ſeuerall humors: Firſt, ſome heare but it is to be rid of their diſeaſes, that is, to ſee whether by hearing Sermons, and comming to Church, they can aſſwage the trouble of their mindes, and dull the ſtinging cares of their hearts. Secondly, ſome are like the young man, for they goe from the Sermon ſorry that the word requireth ſuch things as they are not willing to doe<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 19.</note>. Thirdly, Some heare and ſay, <hi>God forbid</hi>

                  <p>Vnder this rancke I may referre the three ſorts of hearers, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. The firſt ſort ſuffer the Diuell preſently to take away the Word. The ſecond ſort choake it with cares and luſts. The third forſakes the profeſſion, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and liking of it, in the time of temptation or perſecution.

                  <p>The ſtate of men tranſgreſſing againſt the Word,<note place="margin">The miſery of euill hearers.</note> by refuſing to heare it aright, is exceeding fearefull; if they could ſee their miſerie they would doe as the Prophets require, they would cut their haire and caſt it away, vnder the ſenſe of the horror of Gods indignation<note n="ſ" place="margin">

                  <p>Firſt, that it is the very word of God, and therefore true: conſidering the admirable antiquity of the Story before all other Hiſtories: the dreadfull miracles by which it was confirmed: the certaine euent of the vaticinies or propheſies, the immutable and euery way ſufficient frame of piety, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and diuine worſhip, contained it it: the dureableneſſe of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thereof, which no puniſhments could euer extort out of the hearts of the profeſſors thereof: and laſtly, the dreadfull iudgements vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the word of God is deſcribed by the kind of word, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel.<note place="margin">The doctrine of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, is principally to be taught and learned.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which is the Goſpell]</hi> By the Goſpell is meant the Doctrine of the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Man with his God after the fall. Concerning the Goſpell, wee may in the generall here obſerue; That of all other Doctrines, the Doctrine of a mans Reconciliation with God, is eſpecially to be vrged and explained by the Preacher, and to bee moſt minded and enquired into by the hearer. The knowledge and experience of this point acquaints a man with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power of God:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</note> neuer doe men indeede ſee the <hi>beautie of the feete of Gods ſeruants,</hi> till they haue trauelled about the obtaining of their <hi>peace</hi> with God. If Miniſters would bend the very force of their miniſteries about the ſound and daily inforcing of the Doctrine of mans particular aſſurance of his peace and reconciliation; it would produce, by Gods bleſſing, ſingular fruite. This Doctrine would iudge the very ſecrets of men, and giue them a glimpſe of their laſt doome. It is a moſt preuailing Doctrine, and therefore extreamely enuied in the world. The high Prieſts and Scribes with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people many times ſhew they cannot abide it, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.1.

                        <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24.</note>.

                  <p>In particular, concerning the Goſpell, I enquire into three things. Firſt, wherein this Doctrine lieth. Secondly, who receiue this Doctrine of the Goſpell. Thirdly, what are the effects of it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt; the Goſpell, or the Doctrine of it, lyeth in two things.<note place="margin">What the Goſpell prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally vrgeth.</note>

                  <p>Firſt, in our true repentance for our ſinnes, and ſecondly in the infallible aſſurance of faith in Gods fauour, in Chriſt, forgiuing vs our ſinnes, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.15. and this duly waighed, Firſt, reproues thoſe that dreame of ſaluation, and the benefits of the Goſpell without mortification: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ſhould teach vs to nouriſh faith by all meanes, by nouriſhing of deſires; by remouing of lets; praying for it; waiting vpon hearing; behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the faith of Gods children, and deliuering vp our ſoules to ſome able and wiſe Paſtor.</p>

                     <hi>And is come vnto you.]</hi> Where wee may obſerue, that if the meanes of happineſſe finde vs not out to worke vpon vs, wee would neuer looke after it: if God were not more carefull to ſend it, then we to ſeeke it, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be had. Wee ſee this by common experience, that whole multitudes of people liue without any ſenſe of the want of the Word, and did not God by ſome great prouidence ſend it them, and perſwade them to the vſe of it; it would neuer be had: and this comes to paſſe becauſe men are dead in ſinne, and ſicke of a Lethargie in the very vſe of the light of Nature, in matters of godlineſſe; and beſides, there is an incredible inclination in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſeeke for contentment in things below, and to bee pleaſed with any condition, rather then ſoundly to digeſt a ſenſe of the neceſſitie of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the meanes for happineſſe in better things. And laſtly, this neglect of ſeeking the Word, comes from errours about mens eſtate, while they thinke that they may be in Gods fauour, and like enough to be ſaued, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch adoe.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the fourth part.</p>
                  <p>The fift thing in the deſcription is, the ſubiect perſons to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell came, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Coloſſians, and all the World.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you, as it is euen vnto all the World.]</hi> Hence wee may note, Firſt, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Truth of God in his promiſes: hee promiſed flouriſhing Churches of the Gentiles; and loe, it is effected: the Word is gone out into all the World. Secondly, That the true triall of all Doctrine is by enquiring, whether it bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> agreeable to that Doctrine wherein the world was ouercome to GOD. Though an Angell from Heauen ſhould preach otherwiſe,<note place="margin">A triall of Doctrine.</note> yet his Doctrine were to bee deteſted as accurſed<note n="l" place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, that men are bound to ſeeke the word whereſoeuer it may bee heard: for if this had not beene ſo,<note place="margin">Men muſt ſeeke the word when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it may be had.</note> how could all the world receiue the light of the Goſpell? and further, wee may ſee that the want of Teachers was no warrant to commit the Churches to the care of ſuch as could not teach; a neceſſity lieth in the people to ſeeke the word where it may be had. And therfore thoſe Church-gouernours ſinne greeuouſly, that in this light, create ſo many inſufficient men, and ſet them ouer the flocks of CHRIST. For if want of able men had beene a reaſon, the Apoſtles ſhould haue ſeene into this neceſſity, to eaſe the labour and care of the Churches, but it is a more greeuous ſinne to admit, ordaine, and place them, and yet ſee many worthy and able men wholly want places.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">All the world cannot ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man in the world.</note> wee might heere note the vanity of their argument that would proue vniuerſall grace, becauſe Chriſt died for all men; for in this place here is not onely the world, but all the world; and yet here cannot in any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſence be meant all the ſingular men and women in the world; for there were many thouſands of particular perſons, to whom the Goſpell came not, and therefore by all the world (as heere, ſo in that queſtion) may bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the Elect world: or if the world vniuerſally, then it is true in reſpect of offer, or not excepting out of any of any Nation; or by all the world is ment men of all ſorts and conditions in the world.</p>

It is noted of a good tree that his leaues ſhall not faile; and it is certaine that the word maketh the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of profeſſion both more and more inoffenſiue.

                  <p>Thus of the firſt thing in the efficacie of the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> what it doth. The ſecond thing is vpon whom it worketh, or the ſubiect-perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As it is alſo in you] Doct.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note> It helpes not vs that others (though many) bee wrought vpon by the word, gathered, made fruitfull, and increaſed: vnleſſe we be ſure of the efficacie of it in our ſelues. It had beene a ſmall comfort to the Coloſſians to know that the word was fruitfull all ouer the World, if it had no power amongſt them. There is a windie vanitie preuailes in the heades of many hearers, they thinke they doe worthily when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Sermon, praiſe the Preacher, tell of the working of the Word in ſuch and ſuch, though they perceiue not that vnto them it is but a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Many are full-mouthed, but haue emptie hearts and hands: but it ſhould be our diſcretion to labour the cure of this looſeneſſe and wandering of heart, and not to ſuffer our ſoules to be led aſide from conſidering our owne way by any ſuch ſmooth wiles of Satan. Thus of the perſons; the time followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the day.]</hi> Here I obſerue three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">There is a ſeaſon for fruit.</note>Firſt, that there is a ſeaſon for men to be fruitfull in. We are naturally dry trees, or no trees: Wee are but dead ſtockes: neither if wee ſhould ſtand in Gods Orchard to all eternitie, would we of our ſelues beare the fruits of the Goſpell, or exerciſe our ſelues in thoſe faire fruits that are vnto eternall life: if before this day the Citie of Coloſſe had beene ſearched with lights, there would haue beene found no true fruits of Grace or Righteouſneſſe amongſt them: our ſeaſon to beare fruit is then when God calles for it. At ſome time of our life, God (giuing vs the meanes) doth ſet before vs the wav of Life and death, affects vs inwardly with ſence of our miſerie, or the glory of conuerſion, or the neceſſitie of our repentance. Now when the Axe of Gods Word is laide thus neere to the roote of the Tree, it is then time to beare fruit, or elſe we are in danger. The conſideration hereof, as it ſhewes that the workes of ciuill honeſt men are but ſhadowes or blaſted fruite: ſo it ſhould inforce vpon vs a feare of ſtanding out the day of our viſitation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with thy ſelfe, God calls now for repentance, and the duties of new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. If now thou anſwere Gods call, and pray God to make thee ſuch as hee requires thee to be, thou maieſt finde fauour in his eyes; for God <hi>is neere them that call vpon him</hi> if they <hi>ſeeke him in due time, while hee may bee found:</hi> but if thou delay; conſider firſt, that thy heart of it ſelfe without dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, will neuer be fruitfull: ſecondly, that thou art not ſure of the meanes hereafter: thirdly, if thou wereſt ſure, yet who can preſcribe vnto the moſt high? <hi>Hee hath called, and thou haſt not anſwered;</hi> therefore feare his Iuſtice, <hi>thou maiſt call and he will not anſwere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is exceeding praiſe-worthy, and a ſingular mercie of God, if the word of God worke ſpeedily vpon vs; if wee yeeld and ſtoope with the firſt; if it make vs fruitfull from the firſt day. This liuely working of the word, firſt is a ſeale to the word it ſelfe; for hereby it is out of all doubt, that it is the true word of God, and this effectuall worke of Grace vpon our conſciences, doth fence vs againſt a thouſand obiections about the Word: ſecondly, it is the Miniſters ſeale; as ſoone as hee ſeeth this power of Doctrine; hee hath his ſeale from God: the fruitfulneſſe of the people, is the Preachers teſtimoniall<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2.</note>: thirdly, ſo ſoone as we finde the Word to bee a ſauour of life vnto vs, it becomes a ſeale to our owne Adoption to life; and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4894:68"/> therefore we ſhould againe, euery man, be admoniſhed, to take heede of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the time; for not onely we want the teſtimony of our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, while we liue without ſubiecting our ſoules to the power of the word, but exceedingly prouoke God againſt vs: wee ſhould conſider that the holy Ghoſt ſaith peremptorily, <hi>Now is the Axe layd to the roote of the Tree, and euery Tree that bringeth not foorth fruit is cut downe and caſt into the fire.</hi> Note that hee requireth preſent fruit, or threatneth preſent execution<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.2.</note>. Neither may we harden our owne hearts with preſumption, becauſe wee ſee not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent execution vpon this rebellion of man againſt God, and the offer of his grace: for wee muſt know that men are cut off by more wayes then one. Some are cut off by death, as an open reuenge of the ſecret rebellion of the heart, not opening when the ſpirit of grace knocketh. Some are cut off by ſpirituall famine; God remouing the meanes from them, or ſuffering them to be their owne executioners, by withdrawing themſelues from the meanes. Some men are cut off by Gods fearefull Iudgement, being caſt into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſence. Some are cut off by Church-cenſures, God ratifying in Heauen, what is done in Earth by the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence wee learne, that if we would be truely fruitfull, wee muſt be conſtantly ſo; not loſe a leafe, much leſſe giue ouer bearing fruit<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ezech</hi> 47.12.</note>. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine flaſhes will not ſerue turne: the Lord knowes not how to entreat them, whoſe goodneſſe is but like the morning deaw<note n="q" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this efficacy is limited; Firſt, by the kinde of Doctrine which eſpecially makes men fruitfull, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrine of the grace of God: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the application of it, both by Hearing and Knowledge, and both are limited, in that they are required to be in the truth.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That yee heard and knew the grace of God in truth.]</hi> In the opening of theſe words I conſider, firſt, the words apart: ſecondly, the Doctrines out of the whole. For the firſt: heere are three things to be conſidered: 1. what grace of God the Goſpell propounds to men: 2. what we muſt doe that we may haue the comfort of this, that we doe truly heare: 3. what it is to know truely.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">Fiue things principally to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from Gods Grace.</note> the Goſpell requires of men a deepe ſence of the ſingular Grace or free Mercy of God towards men, and that principally in fiue things: firſt, in giuing Chriſt to mankinde fallen; and finding out ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie a meanes of our deliuerance: ſecondly, in accepting of the mediation of Chriſt in particular for the beleeuer, in the age that hee liueth in: thirdly, in forgiuing ſinnes paſt, through his patience: fourthly, in bleſſing the meanes, for mans ſanctification: and laſtly, in allowing vnto men their lot in the inheritance of the Saints in heauen.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, men may be ſaid to know, and yet not truely: firſt, when they know <hi>falſe things,</hi> as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to know the doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Interceſſion of Saints, Image-worſhip, the Supremacie of the Pope: or in <hi>Germany,</hi> to know the Vbiquitie of Chriſts humane nature, vniuerſall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4894:69"/> grace, falling from grace; or that the Sacraments conferre to all, the graces they ſignifie, and ſuch like. Secondly, when men haue the forme of words, and vnderſtand not the meaning. Thirdly, when the notions of the truth are entertained in the minde, and not let downe into the affections; when men haue knowledge in their heads and no affections in their hearts: the Law ſhould be <hi>written in their hearts.</hi> Fourthly, when men know things by <hi>opinion,</hi> not <hi>by faith,</hi> as the moſt men know the greateſt part of Religion.

This comes to paſſe (where it is effectually preached) becauſe it is hindred by common hope, and by a reſolution in many to part with no ſinne for the attaining of it; and by a naturall darkeneſſe in the vnderſtanding of man in matters of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and by the ſpeciall malice of the Deuill, and by pride in other knowledges.

A man needs neuer care for diſputes and the thouſands of Volumes, about which ſhould be the true Church or true Religion? for if a man by ſound reaſons from the word and Spirit of God, had gotten the aſſurance of Gods loue, hee would become <hi>as Mount Sion, that could not be mooued.</hi> This alſo would make a man able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all earthly mutations, and liue in firmenes of heart, in ſome meaſure, out of the feare of any afflictions, or of death it ſelfe: and beſides, it would

                  <p>When men get from vnder the Law to liue vnder Grace, it workes not onely a diſſolution of the dominion of ſinne, but a conſecration of the members for the ſeruice of righteouſneſſe<note n="a" place="margin">

                        <hi>Pro:</hi> 3:34.</note>, and labour for a hatred of euery ſinne; for till then wee neuer get any ſound experience of Gods fauour.

                     <note place="margin">What a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould be.</note>Firſt, it much matters to the efficacie of the doctrine what the Miniſters be: hee that would profit his hearers muſt be; Firſt, able to teach.

Thirdly, hee had neede to be a fellow-ſeruant, one that will draw with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Fourthly, hee muſt conſecrate his ſeruice to God and the Church. Fiftly, he muſt be faithfull. And laſtly, one that will loue his people.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> Secondly, Miniſters of greater gifts, or places, or learning, may here learne how to carry themſelues towards their fellow-Miniſters: <hi>Paul</hi> commends <hi>Epaphras,</hi> confirmes and countenances his doctrine, and giues him <hi>the right hand of fellowſhip.</hi> Which example much condemnes the haughtie pride and arrogancy of many great Cleargy-men, in whoſe eyes their brethren are deſpiſed; ſometime ſwelling againſt them with enuie, ſometimes openly purſuing them with cenſures, eſpecially if God bleſſe their labours with any good ſucceſſe; eaſily ſetting out with the formoſt to detract from their iuſt praiſes for gifts, ſinceritie, or paines: woe and a fall will be to the great pride of Cleargy-men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſtriues to winne a greater eſtimation to the Miniſter that ſo hee might the better faſten their reſpects to his Miniſtery, to note that where the Meſſenger is not in credit, the Meſſage is eaſily neglected or contemned. And therefore as men would deſire good ſucceſſe in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word, they ſhould labour to get and retaine an honourable opinion of the Miniſters.

                  <p>From theſe words <hi>(as ye alſo haue learned of Epaphras,)</hi> I obſerue: Firſt that if men would bee effectually wrought vpon by the word, they muſt plant themſelues vnder ſome ſetled Miniſterie: they that heare now one, and then another, at one end of the quarter heare a ſermon of this man, and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of that man, haue their knowledge much like their paines.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is a true member of the Church that can ſhew ſound grace and knowledge, learned of the Teachers of the Church. It is neither the account of the world, nor profeſſion of true Religion, nor comming to Church, demonſtrates neceſſarily a true member of the Church, but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall ſubiection of the ſoule to be formed and wrought vpon by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is an ordinary infirmity in the better ſort of hearers that in many points they receiue Doctrine vpon the credit of the teachers, yeelding no other reaſon, but <hi>Epaphras</hi> taught ſo; which ſhould awaken affection and conſcience in Miniſters, out of the feare of God, and ſound and infallible knowledge and premeditation to deliuer what they doe deliuer, and to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing for certaine but the word of God.</p>
                  <p>From theſe words <hi>(the beloued, our fellow-ſeruant,)</hi> I obſerue, firſt, that common affliction for the cauſe of God, workes in men tenderneſſe of loue. The Priſon makes a great Apoſtle imbrace with ſingular loue a poore and meane Miniſter; the ſmell of the priſon, and ſight of the ſtake, (if ſuch times ſhould euer come againe) would frame a better amity amongſt our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ambitious men might then lay downe their perſonall and guilefull eagerneſſe of haſt and hate; and humorous men would then bee aſhamed to deuiſe how to inlarge the diſſention, by coyning new exceptions, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4894:70"/> vrging of peremptory new ſcruples: modeſt and humble men on both ſides that haue ſought the peace of Sion, would then haue double honour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that hee that is faithfull is beloued; beloued I ſay of God and Gods houſhold. It is an ill ſigne in a Miniſter that hee is not ſound, when hee findes no tokens of Gods loue in his heart, nor ſignes of reſpect with Gods ſeruants in his life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that to be Gods Seruant is an high dignitie: it is here the ſpeciall glory of an Apoſtle, and was acknowledged and proclaimed to be the beſt part of a Kings title, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. the title of it. Which may ſerue for comfort to poore Chriſtians: they can get no Wealth, offices, nor Honours in the world; but here is their ioy, they may get to bee Gods ſeruants, which is better and more worth than all Honour. Beſides, it condemnes the aſpiring of the Cleargie: yet when they haue done all they can to make themſelues great men, hee is a better man in Gods bookes, that by faithfull ſeruice can winne ſoules to God, then he that by his money or paines can only purchaſe many liuings and great dignities to himſelfe.</p>

But the Doctrine I obſerue is:</p>
                  <p>That euery faithfull Miniſter is Chriſts <hi>Deacon:</hi> and this may comfort painefull Miniſters; for to be Chriſts Deacon is no baſe office; or to be called ſo, a title of diſgrace: for it is a title giuen to Chriſt, and the greateſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. And concerning them is that promiſe that hee that receiueth one of them in Chriſts name, ſhall not be without his reward<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.35. <hi>with</hi> 37.</note>. Beſides, Chriſt ſaith of them, that where hee is, there <hi>ſhall his Deacon</hi> or Seruant <hi>bee,</hi> and his father will honour him, though the world doe not<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.26.</note>. Further, it may refreſh them that they are ſaid to be <hi>Deacons, not of the Letter, but of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7.8. Laſtly, wee may ſee what power theſe Deacons haue, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. They call, they perſwade, they are heard of the great King, if they complaine and informe; and they binde men hand and foote and caſt them into vtter darkeneſſe. Onely, if Miniſters would haue the priuiledges of Chriſts Deacons, they muſt put on and practiſe their properties. Firſt, they muſt become as little Children: for humbleneſſe of minde and confidence in Gods fatherly care and prouidence, and for freedome from malice<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.35.36.</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they muſt follow their Maſter Chriſt, in doctrine, in life, and in ſufferings<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.26.</note>. Thirdly, ſeeing they haue this <hi>Deaconſhip, as they haue receiued mercy, they ſhould not faint, but caſt from them the cloakes of ſhame, and not walke in craftineſſe, nor handle the word of God deceitfully; but in declaration of the truth ſhould approue themſelues to euery mans conſcience in the ſight of God</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 4.1.2</note>. So as for the daily expreſſing of their doctrine vpon the hearts and liues of the people, their people might be their <hi>Epiſtle</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe.</hi> Out of the 8. <hi>Verſe</hi> I obſerue diuers things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the word <hi>[declared,]</hi> as it is here vſed and applyed to reports, I note, that thoſe things are to be reported and ſpoken, that may giue light to the hearers. A good mans report tends to cleare things in the mindes of them that heare him: there ſhould be light and a Lantherne in our words<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.23.</note>. To this end wee ſhould vſe wiſedome, and truth, and meekeneſſe, when wee ſpeake: Wiſedome, by preparing our ſelues to ſpeake: Truth, to report things as they are: and meekeneſſe, to auoide paſſion; for anger is a great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4894:71"/> darkener. We ſhould alſo take heede of diuers ſinnes in both Tables, that greatly corrupt the hearers, not onely in the generall, but in this, that they greatly darken and make muddy the vnderſtanding of man. As in the firſt Table, diſcourſes or diſputes of Atheiſme againſt the Word, Religion, or Ordinances of God; Apologies for Idolaters or Idolatrous Religion, in whole or in part; the very naming of vices or Idols without diſgracing or hating of them; Impatiencie or murmuring againſt God, and ſuch like: And in the ſecond Table, flattery, tale-bearing, falſe accuſing, raſh iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, anſwering of matters before they be heard, are great darkeners of the vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that <hi>Epaphras</hi> intending to complaine of them for their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in opinion and worſhippe, doth here firſt declare their praiſes and graces of Gods Spirit. It ſhewes that it is a worthy grace to be apt to expreſſe others iuſt praiſes, eſpecially when we are to ſpeake of their faults; for that will ſhew that we are free from <hi>enuie,</hi> oſtentation or diſdaine, and that <hi>wee ſeeke not our owne things,</hi> that wee are not ſuſpitious, <hi>nor thinke euill, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in euill.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Loue in the ſpirit]</hi> Loue is either in God or in man: in God there is the perſonall loue of Chriſt, the loue of the Creature, the loue of man, and the loue of goodneſſe or good men:<note place="margin">

                  <p>THeſe words are the ſecond part of the Preface, wherein he ſheweth that hee praied for them, which hee both generally affirmes,<note place="margin">The Diuiſion.</note> and ſpecially declares.</p>
                  <p>The generall affirmation is in theſe words: <hi>For this cauſe, wee alſo, ſince the day we heard of it, ceaſe not to pray for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall Declaration is in the words that follow: <hi>And to deſire that yee might be fulfilled with the knowledge of his will:</hi> and ſo forward to the end of the 11. Verſe.</p>
                  <p>In the affirmation are three things: firſt, an Intimation of a reaſon, <hi>(for this cauſe;)</hi> ſecondly, the Notation of time, <hi>(ſince the day wee heard of it;)</hi> thirdly, the Matter affirmed, <hi>(we ceaſe not to pray for you.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In generall wee may plainely obſerue that the deſires of our hearts,<note place="margin">We are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borne, nor borne againe for our ſelues.</note> and endeauours of our liues ought not to be imployed for our owne good one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for the good of others. Wee are neyther borne nor borne againe for our ſelues. Sanctified and holy men haue beene full of conſtant and ardent affections and deſires after the good of Gods Children: <hi>The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſpirit is giuen to euery member to profit withall</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note>. Religious Loue ſeeketh not his owne things<note n="y" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note>: wee ſhould not <hi>ſeeke our owne things,</hi> as many doe, but that <hi>which is Ieſus Chriſts, viz.</hi> that which tends to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the profit of his members: yea, Chriſtians ſhould <hi>ſerue one another by loue:</hi> hee is not of God that hath not holy affections to promote ſo farre as in him lyeth, the good of Gods Children<note n="z" place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.10.</note>. <hi>Herein are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and the Children of the Diuell</hi> vſually <hi>knowne:</hi> certainely that which any man is in Religion, hee is relatiuely; if not fit to ſerue the body,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then not fit to be of the body; hee is not a Saint, that ſeekes not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerue: Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note> to ſhew the miſerie of ſuch as haue no inflamed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after the good of Gods Children. Secondly, it may giue vs occaſion to examine our ſelues, what good the body of Chriſt reapes by vs. If any Chriſtian of leſſe power, gifts and meanes in the world, aske; what good can I doe to Chriſtians? I anſwere, if thou canſt doe nothing elſe, thou canſt pray to God for them, and deſire their good, reioyce in their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and mourne for their miſeries: neither let this be thought a meane and vnprofitable ſeruice to the body; for wee ſee here a great Apoſtle imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe about ſuch worke: yea, thou doſt benefit the body by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping an holy order in thine owne worke, walking inoffenſiuely. If one ſtone flie out of the building it may breede great annoyance to the whole. Thirdly, this ſhould teach vs to auoide what lets our deſires or abilities to ſerue the Brethren by loue, and what may wrong the body: Take heede of worldlineſſe, euen theſe carking cares, or plodding thoughts, about earthly things: vſe the world, but ſerue it not: take heede of irreligiouſneſſe or the common prophaneneſſe of the world: take heede of raſh cenſuring, and the cuſtomary liberty of ſpeech to iudge, and maſter-like to taxe the actions of others: laſtly, take heede of preſumptuous and ſcandalous courſes of life. And here alſo may be gathered a comfort to afflicted conſciences, that are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4894:72"/> diſtreſſed, becauſe they finde not what they would in themſelues: they muſt know that one great way of triall of ſinceritie, is by the conſtant vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their hearts, in the deſires of good to the Church and people of God. And therefore though they cannot ſpeake ſo much good of themſelues as were meete, yet it is a great grace of God, that they haue inflamed affections to wiſh all ſpirituall proſperitie to Gods people, and to bleſſe them in the Name of the Lord.</p>

                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> When thou ſeeſt the word begin to work in any place pray feruently to God.</note>
                     <hi>For this cauſe.] Doct.</hi> When we ſee the Word of God beginning to worke effectually in any people, and that they wax fruitfull, it is the dutie of all that loue Sion, to beſtirre themſelues, and cry mightily to God, with vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant prayers for them. If it be asked what we ſhould pray for, or wiſh vnto them. I anſwere, wee ſhould pray; firſt that God would reſtraine the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and all wicked men, that profeſſion bee not diſhonoured in the birth of it, by ſcandalous perſons: for it is one of the firſt practiſes of the Diuell, to thruſt up wicked men into profeſſion,<note place="margin">What thou ſhouldeſt pray for.</note> that ſo the glory of ſinceritie might be darkened. Secondly, that the word might haue free paſſage without interruption or hurtfull oppoſition. Seldome doth powerfull preaching make a diuiſion in the heape, but the Diuell and diuelliſh men ſtriue to wring the Fanne out of Chriſts hand, that the winnowing may ceaſe. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that ſeparates the precious from the vile, and without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yeelds comfort to the gracious, and terrours, as the onely preſent portion of the prophane, is exceedingly oppoſed of the world. Thirdly, that they may grow in grace. But, to omit other things, the Apoſtle here ſhewes by his owne example that we ſhould pray; firſt, that they may truely <hi>know the will of God</hi> in Chriſt: ſecondly, that they be diſcreete and <hi>wiſe</hi> in carriage, as well as in <hi>vnderſtanding:</hi> thirdly, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Since the day that wee heard of it, wee ceaſe not to pray for you.]</hi> Firſt, from the coherence of theſe words with the words following, wee may note the great efficacie of Prayer, how mightily it preuailes with God: it is a way by which a Chriſtian may exceedingly helpe himſelfe and pleaſure his friends <hi>The prayer of the righteous auaileth much,</hi> both for helping of the body, and healing of the ſoule<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>And that wee may be incouraged to Prayer, there are diuers things that might vndoubtedly perſwade vs to reſolue of the efficacie of prayer.<note place="margin">Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prayer.</note> Firſt, <hi>Gods Commandement;</hi> certainely God will not require prayer but that hee meanes to heare it<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15.</note>. Secondly, <hi>The Nature of God,</hi> he is <hi>a Father,</hi> and hath the <hi>compaſſions of a Father. Though Abraham would not know his ſeede,</hi> if they had ſuites to him, <hi>and Iacob be ignorant of his poſteritie; yet God will heare and redeeme</hi>

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 7.9.</note>? Thirdly, <hi>the manner of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of grace;</hi> when wee haue any ſuites, hee is not farre off, or hard to come to, as earthly Princes are, and great men in world many times;

God is euer ready to heare, if our hearts were ready to pray. Fourthly, <hi>The property of Gods liberality;</hi> hee holdes it a great blemiſh and diſhonour to his bounty, either to deny when hee is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or to reproach when hee hath giuen; either to except againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to ſticke at the greatneſſe of the gift<note n="h" place="margin">

This Humilitie is euer ioyned with great Faith and wiſhed ſucceſſe in all ſuites to God. Againe, it is to bee noted, that men may bee deceiued about the ſucceſſe of Prayer: for the decree for our ſuccours may goe foorth at the very beginning of our ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, though the knowledge of it bee not reuealed vnto vs till afterwards. Further, God heareth prayers diuerſly; ſometimes, hee heareth to grant the verie thing we deſire; ſometimes he heareth, and granteth, and giueth, not the verie things wee deſire, but that which hee holds to bee beſt for vs, and for the diſtreſſe wee are in: ſo hee was ſayd to heare CHRIST, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.

                  <p>Thus of the generall Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of ſauing Knowledge is here rendred <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> and is <hi>Contemplatiue Knowledge.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Contemplatiue Knowledge</hi> hath in it two things, <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that is, the power to diſcerne Doctrine, and the power to meditate
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4894:76"/> of it; both are needfull, and in both men are exceeding wanting; eſpecially in the power of Meditation. If you aske mee what the obiect is about which wee ſhould meditate, it is anſwered before; it is the Will of God, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, approuing, preſcribing and diſpoſing. And it is no wonder, that men get ſo little knowledge, or are ſo vnable for contemplation, becauſe euery one is not capable of it; <hi>the Scorner may,</hi> in a paſſion, <hi>ſeeke wiſedome, but hee cannot finde it</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro:</hi> 14.6.</note>. Beſides, the meanes muſt be vſed: eſpecially in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is exceeding hard to hold any courſe conſtantly, but the ground muſt be from matter of praier, or hearing, or reading. Further,<note place="margin">Rules for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</note> many things are required to fit a man to capableneſſe, and power of holy Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Firſt, <hi>Chaſtitie of heart,</hi> and affections; for ſuch as are <hi>caryed about with luſts are euer learning, but neuer come to the knowledge of the truth</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.6.</note>. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Meekeneſſe,</hi> or reſt of heart from the hurry of diſordered affections and troubled paſſions; haſty affections and a fooliſh minde are inſeparable; hee that is paſſionate can lift vp no holy thoughts, but hee can eaſily <hi>exalt folly</hi>

                        <hi>Pro:</hi> 14.29</note>. Thirdly, <hi>A good minde,</hi> that is, an vnderſtanding, not exerciſed in imagining and plodding of euill: <hi>men of wicked imaginations</hi> are vtterly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for contemplation. Fourthly, <hi>Humilitie,</hi> or a tender ſenſe of ones owne wants and vnworthineſſe: the proud-conceited man, for matter of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is of an emptie minde, vnleſſe it be that they <hi>dote about queſtions,</hi> or <hi>ſtrife of words,</hi> or <hi>vaine diſputations,</hi> that tend to nothing but ſtrife or vaine oſtentation<note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.4.5.</note>. Beſides, a heart fatted and fleſhed with preſumptuous hopes, or profits and pleaſures, and hardened through long cuſtome and practiſe of ſinne, is almoſt wholy blinded in the things that belong to the Kingdome of CHRIST; <hi>Theſe men haue eyes, and ſee not; and eares and</hi> are as if they <hi>heard not</hi>

                  <p>To paſſe from this point of <hi>Knowledge Contemplatiue,</hi> I conclude onely with the conſideration of the 8. of the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> where it is the drift of the holy Ghoſt to perſwade men to ſeeke to ſtore their hearts with knowledge, both for ſenſe and Vſe. <hi>Wiſedome cries</hi> to be heard. God would faine faſten knowledge vpon all ſorts of men. Now if any ſhould aske why Wiſedome is ſo importunate, or wherefore they muſt ſet all aſide to get her; there are three Reaſons giuen. Firſt, becauſe wee are naturally <hi>fooliſh,</hi> and not wiſe in heart: there is no inward ſubſtance of ſound knowledge in vs, <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. Secondly, the things to bee imparted are the moſt <hi>excellent</hi> in heauen and earth, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 6. Thirdly, no knowledge but this,<note place="margin">Diuers obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt Knowledge anſwered.</note> but it is ſtained with <hi>errour or lewdneſſe:</hi> now in the Scripture wee are ſure of two things, Truth and Puritie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Doctrine of Religion, as it is reuealed in Scripture, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding croſſe and contrary to our natures. <hi>Sol.</hi> It is anſwered, that <hi>there <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Thus of walking, or holy conuerſation in the generall: now in particular, that we might walke in an holy eminency, three things (as is before noted) are heere vrged.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that wee ſhould <hi>walke worthy of the Lord.]</hi> That is, ſo to know and conſider the ſingular mercies of God in Chriſt, as to endeauour to expreſſe our thankefulneſſe in the obedience of our liues, in ſuch a meaſure as might become the mercies of God. Before I open the words further, I conſider in the generall, two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the obedience of the faithfull is rayſed by the contemplation of the mercies of God: which ſhould teach vs,<note place="margin">2 Generall obſeruations.</note> as wee deſire more to abound in good fruites, ſo to be more in the aſſurance, and often meditation of Gods loue to vs: more knowledge of this kinde would worke more obedience; and a confuſed knowledge of Gods mercy is vſually accompanied with an vnconſtant obedience. Beſides, this reprooues the dangerous and ſinfull abuſe of Gods mercies in the common people, that vſe to plead their ſafetie (notwithſtanding their ſinnes) by the alledging of the mercy of God to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: whereas it is moſt certaine, that the right knowledge of Gods mercy would make men afraid to ſinne; <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou maiſt be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4.</note>: and it is the infallible ſigne of a true conuert, that hee doth <hi>feare God and his goodneſſe</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5.</note>: euery man can feare God and his Iuſtice, eſpecially in ſome kindes of iudgements; but a childe of God doth neuer more tenderly feare God, then when hee hath greateſt taſte of Gods mercies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Papiſts would finde merit of workes in this Verſe: both becauſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life is ſo much vrged, as alſo becauſe heere is the word <hi>[worthy]</hi> vſed as if the Apoſtle ſhould grant, that they might be worthy of, and merit the bleſſings of God.</p>
                  <p>My anſwere is, Firſt, that merit cannot be founded vpon Scripture;<note place="margin">Againſt merit of workes.</note> and ſecondly, it cannot bee founded vpon this Scripture. For the firſt, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit for many reaſons in Scripture: firſt, wee are <hi>not our owne</hi> men, wee are ſo tyed vnto God that gaue vs beeing in Nature and Grace, that when <hi>wee haue done all wee can doe,</hi> our owne mouthes muſt ſay <hi>wee are but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Seruants</hi>

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 17.</note>. Secondly, <hi>all our ſufficiencie to doe any good is of God, not from our ſelues</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</note>. Thirdly, God gaines nothing by vs. <hi>If thou be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, what giueſt thou to him?</hi> or, <hi>what receiueth hee at thy hands</hi>

If the Papiſts will firſt goe to hell for their ſinnes, and ſtay all that eternity there, then afterwards if God create another eternity, they may haue hearing to relate what good they haue done: the curſe of the Law will be firſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; the puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> one ſinne barred the plea for any reward for former righteouſneſſe. Fiftly, what compariſon can there be betweene the glory of Heauen, and our workes on earth<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</note>? Sixtly, it is worthy to bee obſerued, that it is <hi>mercy</hi> in God to ſet his <hi>loue</hi> vpon <hi>them that keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Command.</hi> 2.

                  <p>Secondly, This place hath no colour for merit: for (to paſſe ouer that reaſon, that the Scripture requireth good workes, therefore our workes merit, as a moſt falſe and abſurd argument:) the wordes <hi>[worthy of the Lord]</hi> cannot be applied to merit by any meanes: for in as much as the Lord had beſtowed many of his fauours already vppon them, and giuing his hand
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4894:80"/> and writing, and ſeale for the reſt, they cannot by any workes afterwards be ſaid in any colour to merit what is paſt. They are vrged, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. to bring foorth fruites woorthy repentance: now it were abſurd to thinke that the fruits afterwards borne, ſhould merit repentance, which God gaue before; for that is to affirme that not onely a wicked man might merit his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, but that hee might merit it by the workes hee would doe after his conuerſion, which I know not that any Papiſt will affirme: and the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there of the phraſe here vſed.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, that euen after regeneration there may be ſometimes ſome working of the ſeedes of Atheiſme.

                  <p>Secondly, that increaſe in holy conuerſation doth abate the mouings of Atheiſme: as any be more holy, ſo they are more freed from the trouble of them. Be firſt holy, and then be an Atheiſt, (profeſſed or reſolued,) if thou canſt.</p>

In ſome reſpects by the nature of the Creature; ſo as whatſoeuer deſtroyes the eſſentiall definition of the Creature, God cannot doe: as God cannot make a man vnreaſonable, and yet hee remaine a man; hee cannot make a body infinite, and it remaine a body ſtill: 5. Sometimes by the condition and qualities of the Creature; as, <hi>Be it vnto thee according to thy Faith:</hi> 6. By impoſſibilitie; I ſay, by that which is ſimply impoſſible, for there are many things vnpoſſible in reſpect of vs, which are not onely poſſible but eaſie to God.

                     <hi>Power of his Glory.]</hi> There are foure Reaſons why the Power of God ſhould bee ſaid to bee the <hi>Power of his Glory,</hi> or glorious. 1. Becauſe it will neuer leaue ſtrengthening, till it bring to Glory. 2. Becauſe the power of all the meanes of ſaluation is from heauen, and therefore a glorious power. 3. Becauſe Gods Glory ſets his Power aworke, in as much as by promiſe it lyes ingaged to his people. 4. It is a glorious Power, becauſe of the perſons and things that are vſed in Gods worke, as God himſelfe, the Sonne of God, the Spirit of God, ordinances that are of God, and men ſpecially conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctrines.</hi> Firſt, the perſeuerance of Gods children is moſt certaine: ſo long as there is Power in God or Glory, they cannot fall away by loſing their happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>This point hath abundant and apparant confirmation out of the old Teſtament in theſe places, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 145.10.13.14. <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.3. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 32, 40. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19.

                  <p>Secondly, there is little reaſon of preſumption in this Doctrine: for, as Power will preſerue, ſo Glory will reuenge: if ſuch as are in couenant with God returne to ſinne, woe vnto them, Gods Glory will not beare it; and he hath many wayes to ſcourge them: for by their ſinnes they may bring vpon themſelues croſſes of all ſorts<note n="ſ" place="margin">

Wee muſt <hi>in all things giue thankes:</hi> a heart kept tender with the ſenſe of Gods mercies, is eaſily infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ioyes in the Holy Ghoſt. 3. We muſt take heed of <hi>quenching the Spirit:</hi> when a man puts out the holy motions of the Spirit, hee quencheth his owne ioyes. 4. We muſt, by all meanes, preſerue an honourable reſpect of the word publikely preached: <hi>deſpiſe not prophecying.</hi> 5. And whereas there be ſome things we heare, doe ſpecially affect vs, and concerne vs, wee muſt be carefull with all heedfulneſſe to keepe thoſe things whatſoeuer wee forget: <hi>try all things, but keepe that which is good.</hi> 6. In our practiſe wee muſt not onely auoyd euill, but <hi>all appearance of euill,</hi> elſe if wee diſquiet others with griefe or offence of our carriage, it will be iuſt with God we ſhould finde little reſt, or contentment in our ſelues. Laſtly, wee muſt endeauour to bee <hi>ſanctified throughout,</hi> inwardly and outwardly, <hi>in ſoule, body and ſpirit,</hi> hauing <hi>reſpect to all Gods Commandments,</hi> and retayning the loue of no ſinne, ſo ſhall wee reape the bleſſing of all righteouſneſſe, and procure to our hearts the ioyes that are euerlaſting.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words containe the ſecond part of our Redemption on earth in this world: the redeeming of vs is the tranſlating of vs: and this tranſlation is amplified by the condition of life into which wee are tranſlated, which for the excellencie of it, is into a Kingdome; and for the author of it, is into the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, the Sonne of Gods loue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tranſlated.]</hi> The word, is a Metaphor and the compariſon is taken from Plants in nature, and there are diuers things ſignified vnto vs, concerning our Redemption, in the ſimilitude of tranſlating Plants. As trees are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Winter, not in the Spring; ſo commonly our Redemption is applied in the dayes of ſpeciall affliction and ſorrow<note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 33.14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 31.</note>: and as the Plant is not firſt fruitfull and then tranſlated; but therefore tranſlated, that it may beare fruit: ſo wee are not therefore redeemed becauſe God was in loue with our fruits; but therefore tranſlated out of the kingdome of darkeneſſe, that we might bring foorth fruit vnto God. And as a tree may be truely remoued, and new planted, and yet not preſently beare fruite: ſo may a Chriſtian bee truely tranſlated, and yet in the firſt inſtant of his conuerſion hee may not ſhew foorth all that fruit he doth deſire, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hath in it.</note>In particular, <hi>tranſlating</hi> hath two things in it: firſt, pulling vp: ſecondly, ſetting againe. The pulling vp of the tree, ſhadowes out three things in the conuerſion of a Sinner. Firſt, ſeparation from the world: hee cannot be in Chriſt that hath his heart rooted in the earth, and keepes his olde ſtanding amongſt theſe trees, the wicked of the world. Secondly, deliuerance both from originall ſinne in the raigne of it (which is the moyſture of the olde earth) and alſo from hardneſſe of heart, (for <hi>tranſlating</hi> hath remoouing of the mould and ſtones that were about the roote.) Thirdly, godly ſorrow raiſed by the ſenſe of the ſtroakes of the Axe of Gods threatnings, and by the loſſe of many ſprowts and branches that were hidden in the earth: A Chriſtian cannot ſcape without ſorrow; for hee hath many an vnprofitable ſprowt of vanitie, and ſinfull profit and pleaſure hee muſt part with. The ſetting of the tree notes both our ingrafting into Chriſt by the Spirit of God through Faith, and our communion with the Saints, (the fruitfull trees in Gods Orchard) as alſo it notes our preſeruation by the infuſion of the ſappe of holy graces.</p>

Thirdly, becauſe he is infinitely filled with the ſenſe of his loue: ſo they are ſaid to be the <hi>Children of the marriage,</hi> that are full of ioy, in reſpect of the marriage. Fourthly, becauſe it is hee by whom loue is deriued into others: It is hee that makes all other Sonnes, beloued. Laſtly, in reſpect of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: he is that Sonne vpon whom God hath ſhewed his principall loue, in reſpect of the gifts, with which that nature is admirably qualified. The meditation of this, that CHRIST our Sauiour is the Sonne of Gods loue, is very comfortable; for hee is like to ſpeede in any thing hee requeſts the Father for vs, and hee will be ſure to preſerue vs, that himſelfe is a Kings Sonne, yea, Gods Sonne, yea, a King, and God himſelfe, and ſo infinitely beloued of the Father: it is an excellent thing to be Chriſts member, ſeeing hee inherits ſo great loue: and if God gaue vs this Sonne ſo deare to him, how ſhall hee denie any thing, ſeeing neuer can ought bee ſo precious, but that <hi>with Chriſt hee will willingly giue it?</hi>

Howſoeuer hee appeared in forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, yet hee exceeded all Monarches, that euer were on earth: for Chriſt is the eſſentiall Image of God, whereas the greateſt Monarchs are Gods Image, but by a ſmall participation. Hee is the Sonne of God by generation, they are ſo onely by creation or regeneration. Hee is the firſt borne, they are but yonger brothers at the beſt: Hee is the Creator, they are but Creatures: All things are for him, whereas they haue right and power ouer but few things: hee is eternall, they are mortall. Things cannot conſiſt without a Redeemer in Heauen; but ſo they may without a Monarch on earth: hee is a myſticall Head, and by his Spirit vniteth all his Subiects to him, and by influence preſerueth them: but ſo can no politicall heads doe their Subiects.

                     <hi>Image.]</hi> Our Redeemer reſembles God by way of Image.</p>
                  <p>There is difference betweene the Image of a thing, and the Similitude of it. The Sunne in the Firmament expreſſeth God by Similitude; for as there is but one Sunne, ſo there is but one God: And as no man can looke vpon the Sunne in his brightneſſe; ſo no man can ſee God with mortall eyes, &amp;c. But yet the Sunne is not therefore Gods Image. Gods Image is in Man, and in Chriſt.</p>

Secondly, by Recreation; and ſo it is in holy men, that doe actually and habitually know and conceiue of God, &amp;c. but this is vnperfectly. Thirdly, by ſimilitude of glory; and ſo the bleſſed in heauen conceiue of, and reſemble God, and that (in compariſon with the two former) perfectly.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Image of God in Man and in Chriſt.</note>But there is great difference betweene the Image of God in man, and the Image of God, in Chriſt. In Chriſt, it is as <hi>Caeſars</hi> Image in his Sonne; in Man, it is as <hi>Caeſars</hi> Image in his Coyne. Chriſt is the naturall Image of God, and of the ſame ſubſtance with God, whom he doth reſemble: but the Chriſtian is Gods Image only in ſome reſpects, neither is he of the ſame nature with God. Man is both the <hi>Image of God,</hi> and <hi>after the Image of God; The Image of God</hi> becauſe he truly reſembles God;<note place="margin">Imago, <hi>and</hi> ad Jmaginem.</note> and <hi>after the Image of God,</hi> becauſe hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles him, but vnperfectly. But Chriſt is the perfect Image of God, and not after his Image. Some expreſſe the difference thus: Chriſt is the Image of the inuiſible God, but Man is the Image of the viſible God, that is, of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt, is the Image of God three wayes: 1. in Operation, becauſe it is he that worketh Gods Image in vs: 2. in Apparition, becauſe hee appeared for God, to the Fathers in the old Law: 3. in Perſon, and that in both natures, both as God and Man; for the moſt perfect Image of God, is Chriſt, God: the perfect image of God is Chriſt, Man: the vnperfect Image of God, is Man.</p>

                  <p>That Chriſt is the Image of God, as he is God, is apparant by that place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4. And here, two things are admirable: firſt, that this Image is an infinite Image, like the thing reſembled: ſecondly, that the Image is the ſame in Number, not in <hi>Specie</hi> onely, with the thing reſembled.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt as man, is the Image of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And that three waies: Firſt, as the God-head dwels in Chriſt bodily: in reſpect of the vnutterable preſence of the diuine Nature. Secondly, as by his Miracles and great works, he manifeſted the Diuine Nature, and ſhewed God in the world. Thirldly, as his Humane Nature is qualified with Knowledge, Righteouſneſſe, Purity, and other gifts: for if man be Gods Image in reſpect of this, Chriſt is ſo much more.

                  <p>Hitherto our Redeemer is deſcribed, as he ſtands in relation to God: now, in the ſecond place, he is deſcribed as he ſtands in relation to the Creatures.

                        </gap>.</note> and begotten as God. Things are begotten three waies: 1. <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,</hi> onely by compariſon, or in ſome reſpects: 2. <hi>Corporally:</hi> 3. <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:</hi> ſome things doe beget without themſelues, as bodies doe; but this is more ignobly and baſely; ſome things beget within themſelues, as doth the Spirit or ſoule, more perfectly. But the moſt perfect and vnutterable glorious generation, is the begetting of the Son of God, by God. The way of God in eternity, who can finde out? and his generation who can tell? His waies are not as our waies; yet a glimpſe of this great work, we may reach to two waies:
<list>
                        <item>1 By way of <hi>Negation,</hi> as they ſay in Schooles.</item>
                        <item>2 By way of <hi>Compariſon.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, by denying that vnto God, which hath imperfection in it. In the generation of the Creatures we may ſee ſomething into the generation of the Sonne of God. There are eight things in the generation of the Creatures, which are not in this begetting of the naturall Sonne of God. 1. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beget in time, becauſe themſelues are firſt begotten: but this is not in God, Chriſt is <hi>of the Father,</hi> but not <hi>after the Father:</hi> there is here a prioritie in order, but not in time. 2. The Creatures beget by <hi>affection</hi> (this is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) but God begetteth by <hi>Nature.</hi> 3. The Creature begets without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo as Sons are diuers, and diuided from the Father, becauſe they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> we are of like nature to our Fathers, but not the ſame nature: but it is not ſo in God; for Chriſt is not diuided from the Father, as he is the naturall Sonne of God. 4. The generation in the Creature is not without corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diminution of the nature of the Begetter: but here, God the Father begetteth without corruption or diminution, by a way diuine, inenarrable, and incomprehenſible. 5. Our Children are leſſe then their Parents; but Chriſt is as well <hi>Coequall</hi> as <hi>Coeternall.</hi> 6. The Creature communicates but a part of his ſubſtance, but God communicates the whole. 7. The father and ſonne, among the creatures, are two <hi>in number,</hi> one in <hi>Specie</hi> onely; but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4894:95"/> in God it is not ſo: for the Son of God <hi>is another,</hi> but <hi>not another thing;</hi> he is another, <hi>viz.</hi> in Perſon, but not another thing in Eſſence. Laſtly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alius,</hi> but not <hi>aliud.</hi>
                     </note> the creature begets mortal creatures, &amp; propagates but a being for a time, but God begets a Sonne immortall by nature, ſuch a one as can neuer die in the nature ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this generation is ſhadowed out by ſome compariſon with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the riuer and the ſpring are two, yet not diuided; ſo is the Sun and the Beames of it, the Sauor &amp; the Oyntment are together, and yet the Oyntment is not corrupted: but the principall compariſon is in the minde &amp; the word; the Minde begets the Word naturally, without paſſion or corruption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelfe; ſo as the Word begotten, remaines in the Minde, the Word after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards, clothed with a voyce, goeth into the eares of men, and yet ceaſeth not to be ſtill in the Minde: This in many things, as you may ſee, is like to the generation of Chriſt, by the Father. But all theſe are but ſhadowes; the glory of the thing it ſelfe cannot be expreſſed by any words of man or angels.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this Doctrine ſhould inflame vs to the loue of ſuch a Sonne, who being as hee was, coequall and coeternall with the Father, yet was pleaſed to <hi>delight himſelfe in Gods earth,</hi> which is man.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.22.31.32.</note> And wee ſhould for euer hearken and attend to the words of this wiſedome of God, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs the ſecrets of the very boſome of his Father. And ſeeing this is the Sonne, of whom GOD hath ſpoken to the dreadfull aſtoniſhment and wonder of Heauen and Earth, woe vnto them that ſinne againſt the Sonne, and prouoke him to anger: How ſhall they bee broken to pieces like an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Veſſell?

Concerning this creation of all things, I onely note two things: Firſt, how they were created: ſecondly, the errours that ſprung vp againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>All things were created.]</hi> Firſt, <hi>moſt freely,</hi> without any neceſſitie that compelled God thereunto<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 115.3.</note>. Secondly, <hi>without any labour,</hi> motion, or mutation of himſelfe, with a becke onely; and by his omnipotent <hi>Word</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9.</note>. Thirdly, <hi>of nothing:</hi> of nothing I ſay, negatiuely, in the Creation of the firſt maſſe of all things; and of nothing priuatiuely, in the ſecond Creation of things, out of the firſt maſſe or Chaos. For though in the order of nature, and by men, nothing is made of nothing, yet this extendeth not to God and the firſt Creation. Fourthly, <hi>moſt wiſely,</hi> ſo as there flowed in the Creation, a <hi>goodneſſe</hi> to euery Creature, ſo as <hi>they were all good,</hi> in Gods account<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen:</hi> 1.31.</note>: This Goodneſſe in Man and Angels, was Gods Image in them. Fiftly, <hi>in time,</hi> with time, <hi>in the very beginning</hi> of time<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen:</hi> 1.1.</note>. Sixtly, <hi>in the ſpace of ſixe daies;</hi> not at one time onely, and this ſhewed the Creatures diſabilitie, that could not forme it ſelfe when the firſt matter was created: Herein God alſo ſhewed his power, and that hee was not tied to ſecond cauſes, as hee declared when hee gaue light to the world, while yet there was no <hi>Sunne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then herein hee teacheth men to dwell long vpon the meditation of the Creation, ſeeing God himſelfe did prolong the Creation for ſo many daies, which yet hee could haue diſpatched in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>There were foure errors about the Creation:<note place="margin">Foure words confute foure Errours.</note> Some ſaid the world was eternall: ſome ſaid, though it were not eternall, yet it had a materiall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it was made of ſomething: Some ſaid, God made the Superiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures himſelfe, and the Inferiour by Angels: ſome, made two beginners of things; they imagined that one Beginner made things incorruptible, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, made things corruptible. The very firſt Verſe of the Bible, confutes all foure Errours: the word, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> ſhewes the world was not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: the word <hi>Creation,</hi> notes, that it was made of nothing; when he ſaith, <hi>God</hi> created all, hee excludes Angels: and laſtly, when hee ſaith, God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Heauen and Earth,</hi> hee ſhewes hee was the onely beginner of all ſorts of Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the diſtinction of the Creatures followes:<note place="margin">Sorts of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> here they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed three waies: 1. by Place, ſome are things in <hi>heauen,</hi> ſome things in <hi>earth:</hi> 2. by Qualitie, ſome are <hi>viſible,</hi> ſome are <hi>inuiſible:</hi> 3. by a ſubdiuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inuiſible; ſome are <hi>Thrones,</hi> ſome are <hi>Dominions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     </note>] Theſe words are diuerſly interpreted. Some thinke, there is no neceſſitie to vnderſtand them of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but in generall of all Empire, and of the order of <hi>oeconomie,</hi> among the Creatures, in Marriage, Lawes, or Gouernments, in heauen or Earth. Some reſtraine the words, to order amongſt men onely. Some vnderſtand by Thrones the Pallace of Gods Maieſtie, and the ſeate of bleſſed immortality; and the reſt of the words they interpret of Angels. But the commoneſt opinion, and moſt auncient, is to vnderſtand all the words of Angels onely: But in this there is not agreement, for ſome thinke the Apoſtle ſpeakes by way of Conceſſion, as if hee ſhould ſay: Be it ſo that Angels are <hi>Thrones</hi> and <hi>Dominions, &amp;c.</hi> (as the Iewes and falſe Apoſtles affirme, when they go about to perſwade you to Angel-worſhip) yet if that were granted, Chriſt onely were to be worſhipped, becauſe hee made all thoſe; and what excellency they haue, they had it from him. Others thinke that the Apoſtle reckoneth vp the excellent'ſt things in humane gouernment, and giues them to Angels, to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out their glory; and conſequently, the glory of Chriſt that made them.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4894:97"/> I thinke there is no hurt in their opinion, that giue all theſe words vnto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:<note place="margin">Why Angels are called by theſe names.</note> And they are called <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,</hi> &amp; <hi>Powers,</hi> becauſe God by them gouernes the Nations, and as ſome thinke, moues the Heauens; reſtraines the Deuils, workes Miracles, foretels things to come, protects the faithfull, and exerciſeth his iudgements vpon the world: yet ſo as theſe names may be giuen to all Angels, in diuers reſpects, and vpon occaſion of diuers employments: Or they may be giuen to ſome Angels for a time, and not for euer. Or if it bee yeelded that thoſe names doe diſtinguiſh the diuers ſorts of Angels,<note place="margin">The Vſes of the doctrine of Creation.</note> and their order; yet it will not follow, that wee can tell their ſorts, as the bold <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and the Papiſts haue aduentured to doe.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the doctrine of Creation; the Vſes follow, and they are,

                  </p>
                  <p>The doctrine of Creation cannot but bee a doctrine of great reproofe and terrour to wicked men; becauſe thoſe goodly Creatures, being Gods workemanſhip, will plead againſt them, and make them inexcuſable in the day of CHRIST; in as much as they haue not learned to know and ſerue God with thankefulneſſe and feare, that ſhewed his Wiſedome and Power, and other the inuiſible things of God,<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom:</hi> 1.19.</note> in the making of all thoſe Creatures<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. And beſides, from the great power of God, in the Creation of themſelues and other Creatures, they may ſee that they are in a wofull caſe, that by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>ſtriue with him that made them:</hi> for hee hath the ſame power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <p>And further, if God made all, then he knowes all, and ſo all the ſinnes of the ſinner; and in that hee made all, hee hath at his command as Lord by creation all Armies, to raiſe them againſt the wicked for their ſubuerſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Doctrine of the Creation may comfort Gods Children many waies: firſt, it may comfort them in the faith of the worlds diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it is hee that created Heauen and Earth that will accompliſh it, <hi>that time ſhall be no more,</hi> I meane, not times of mortalitie, ſinne, labour, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 10.6.</note>, &amp;c. Secondly, it may comfort them in the ſucceſſe of Chriſts kingdom on earth. Though it be a great thing to gather men againe into couenant with God, and to open the eyes of men, blinde with ignorance, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſoules of men that haue long lyne in the priſons of ſinne and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; yet wee may be aſſured that God, by the ordinances of Chriſt, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all the great things of this ſpirituall kingdome; becauſe hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to create the Heauens and Earth. And God himſelfe doth remember his power in the Creation, to aſſure his performance in our regeneration<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42.5.6.</note>. Thirdly, it may comfort vs in our vnion with Chriſt; for what ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from his loue? in as much as hee is vnchangeable himſelfe, nothing elſe can, for they are all his Creatures, and muſt not croſſe his reſolued will<note n="i" place="margin">

Laſtly, it may comfort Gods Children, in the expectation of their ſaluation; for God hath promiſed, as certainely as hee hath created the Heauens, <hi>he will ſaue Iſraell,</hi> though it ſhould bee as hard a worke as was the <hi>ſpreading out of the Heauens</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, the doctrine of the Creation ſhould teach vs diuers duties.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the admirableneſſe, and varietie of Gods workes ſhould prouoke vs to contemplation: <hi>How deare are thy thoughts vnto me?</hi> Pſal. 139 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in affliction; wee ſhould willingly commit our ſelues to God, and truſt in him, though our meanes be little, or vnlikely; for he is <hi>a faithfull Creatour:</hi> his loue to vs affords him Will to doe vs good, and the creation proues his Power<note n="q" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 4.19. <hi>Eſa:</hi> 45.12.7.22.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the greatneſſe of the workes in Creation, ſhould imprint in vs Reuerence and Feare, and force vs to the duties of the adoration and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 100.13.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the knowledge of the glory and greatneſſe of the Creator, ſhould inflame in vs indignation againſt Idols, and the worſhip of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.3, 7.10.11.12.14.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the remembrance of our Creator, and Creation, ſhould worke in vs an abatement of our pride and iollitie, and dull the edge of our fierce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to ſinne, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12 1.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the conſideration of our equalitie in our Creation, ſhould keepe vs that we tranſgreſſe not againſt our Brethren: <hi>Wee haue all one Father, and one GOD hath created vs</hi>

                  <p>The third thing in Chriſts relation to the Creatures, is, that <hi>All things are for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For him.]</hi> In diuers, reſpects: firſt, as it is hee onely,<note place="margin">All things are for Chriſt, in diuers reſpects</note> 
                     <hi>in whom the Father is well pleaſed;</hi> and ſo the loue of God to the World is for his ſake. Secondly, as all the Creatures doe ſerue to point out the Sonne, as well as the Father, and that becauſe they ſhew Chriſt, as <hi>the wiſedome of the Father.</hi> And be ſides, their changes and corruptions doe cry for the <hi>libertie of the ſonnes of God</hi> in Chriſt: and further, they are all at commaund, for the propagation, and preſeruing of the kingdome of Chriſt. Thirdly, as <hi>he is heyre of all thingsſ</hi>, they are <hi>for him,</hi> that is, for his glory; ſo as hee is not onely the Efficient, but the finall cauſe of all things. The Carpenter makes his Houſe, perhaps fot one more honourable then himſelfe, but not ſo Chriſt in making this great Houſe, the World. The conſideration of this point, that <hi>all things are for Chriſt,</hi> ſhould teach vs diuers things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wee ſhould leſſe dote vpon the world, and the things thereof,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note> in as much as theſe things were principally made for Chriſt, and not for vs. And ſecondly, wee ſhould vſe all theſe things as helpes to lead vs to CHRIST, Thirdly, in the vſe of the Creatures, wee ſhould be carefull to expreſſe the glory of Chriſt, by giuing thankes, by magnifying his Wiſedome, Power, Goodneſſe, &amp;c. and by diſtributing them; according to his appointment, as to the poore, and to the maintenance of the worſhip of God: for ſeeing they are his, and for him, wee ſhould deſpoſe of them as hee requires. Laſtly, it ſhould keepe vs from the vſe of all ill meanes: for ſeeing it is for Chriſt, wee ſhould not lye, deceiue, vſe falſe weights, runne to Witches, or take any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vngodly courſe; for hee <hi>needes not our lye,</hi> nor deſires to bee helped by any ſinnefull courſe.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:4894:98"/>
                  <p>The fourth thing which Chriſt is commended for, is his Eternitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee was before all things.]</hi>
                  </p>

That Chriſt is eternall theſe places proue, <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.22. <hi>&amp;c. Mich.</hi> 5.2.4. <hi>&amp;c. Reuel.</hi> 1.8.11. and 21.6. and 22.13.</p>
                  <p>The Eternity of Chriſt may be thus defined: it is a pleaſant, and at once, perfect poſſeſſion of endleſſe life.<note place="margin">The Eternity of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and explained.</note> And hereby may the eternitie of Chriſt appeare, to differ from the eternity of all other things. The Heauens haue an endleſneſſe of Eſſence, but they want life. The Diuels haue an endleſſe, not onely being, but life; but it is not a pleaſant life. The Saints in Heauen haue a pleaſant life till the day of Iudgement, but they haue not whole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. The Angels in Heauen haue a whole poſſeſſion, but it is not at once, but ſucceſſiuely, both in reuelation and ioy: I ſay, it is whole in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their whole Nature or Eſſence is poſſeſſed of pleaſant and endleſſe life. And laſtly, Chriſts eternitie differs from all eternitie, of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe no creature hath the former things abſolutely perfect; that is, ſuch a poſſeſſion of endleſſe life, as vnto which nothing is wanting, for they want many of the perfections that are in Chriſt, though they bee perfect in their owne kinde.</p>
                  <p>Seeing Chriſt was before all things, wee ſhould preferre him before all things: wee ſhould acknowledge his Title as heyre of all things: as the eldeſt among all things, wee ſhould willingly heare him ſpeake, and honour his words; wee ſhould truſt in him, and liue by faith, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in him all things conſiſts.]</hi> That is, hee vpholds, rules, and gouernes all things by his prouidence: and this is the fift thing by which our Redeemer is deſcribed in relation to the World. That prouidence is giuen to the Son, as well as Creation, theſe places proue, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.3. <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.12.

                  <p>That Chriſt might become our Head, wee muſt conſider what hee did in fitting himſelfe thereunto: and ſecondly, what hee doth in vs. For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee tooke the ſame Nature with his Church; elſe had the Church beene like <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> Image. Yet as hee tooke our Nature, ſo wee muſt know that hee bettered it. The Head differs in worth from the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein is ſeated the minde, which is the nobleſt part of man: ſo in the humane Nature of Chriſt, dwells the Godhead bodily; and by expiation, in his owne perſon, Chriſt takes away the ſinnes of the Church, which elſe would haue letted all Vnion. And laſtly, hee exalted his ſuffering Nature, and ſeated himſelfe aloft, as meete to haue the preheminence, and become Head of all the faithfull: And as the Head is thus fitted, ſo are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for, 1. they are collected out of the World, by the ſound of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: (Let them lie hidden in the world that meane to periſh with the world.) 2. They are framed, formed, proportioned, and begotten, by daily hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. 3. They are ingrafted in an vnſpeakeable, and inuiſible Vnion; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in truth, afterwards in ſence.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Vſe is for Confutation: and that three waies.<note place="margin">Vſes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in vaine doe the wicked enemies of the Church pride themſelues in the greatneſſe of Learning, Power, Meanes, &amp;c. thinking to ſuppreſſe the being or glory of Chriſts Church on Earth; for <hi>the ſtone that the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refuſed, will proue the Head of the corner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in vaine doe the Papiſts goe about to maintaine their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Head; for the Church is neither without a Head, nor many-Headed. And it is abſurd to excuſe it, that the Pope is but a Head vnder Chriſt: for the body were monſtrous that had two Heads, one aboue, and another vnder.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in vaine doe carnall men pleade their hopes in Chriſt, when they can yeeld no ſound reaſon to prooue they are Chriſts Members. They are not members of this body vnder this Head, that want Faith; that haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt; that are not quickened with the life of Grace; that are not wrought vpon by the word of Chriſt, nor built vpon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophets and Apoſtles, that feele no influence of graces from CHRIST; that want the knowledge of Prophets, or mortification of Prieſts, or victory ouer the World, as Kings; that eyther pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne ciuill righteouſneſſe, or can fall away wholy, and for euer.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, if the Church be the body of Chriſt, and wee Members of this Body, wee ſhould learne to carry our ſelues one towardes another, <hi>in all humbleneſſe of minde, and long-ſuffering, ſupporting one another, and keepe the bond of peace in the vnitie of the ſpirit</hi>

                  <p>Thus of the excellencie of Chriſt, in relation to the Church, as it is briefly propounded: the explication followes.</p>
                  <p>The head hath three Priuiledges, or excels all the Members in <hi>Order, Perfection,</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> and Efficacie. The preheminence of Chriſt is three wayes conſidered. Firſt, in reſpect of the dignitie of Order, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. of order I ſay, toward the Members. Secondly, in reſpect of perfection in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in the fulneſſe of grace, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. Thirdly, in reſpect of Vertue, Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, and influence toward the whole body, <hi>verſe</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>The primacie of CHRIST in order, or relation to the Members, is twofold. Firſt, in the eſtate of Grace, <hi>Hee is the beginning.</hi> Secondly, in the reſpect of the ſtate of Glory, <hi>He is the firſt begotten of the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt is ſaid to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in three reſpects.</note>
                     <hi>He is the beginning.]</hi> Chriſt may be ſaid to bee the beginning, in three reſpects. Firſt, as he is the firſt fruits, for whoſe ſake the reſt are accepted, and bleſſed. Secondly, as hee is the repayrer of the world, decayed by mans ſinne. Thirdly, as hee is the beginning of the good things that are in the Church: hee is both the obiect and efficient cauſe of Faith. Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation flowes from his death, and new Obedience from his Reſurrection; Iuſtification is wrought from his obedience.</p>

                     <hi>The firſt begotten of the dead.] Chriſt,</hi> as head of the Church, holds his relation both to the liuing, as their beginning, and to the dead as their firſt begotten.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold primogeniture of Chriſt: Hee is the firſt begotten. Firſt, in reſpect of eternall generation; as he is the Sonne of God. Of this before. Secondly, as hee is borne of the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> for ſhee is ſaid to bring forth her <hi>firſt begotten Sonne</hi>

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 1.</note>. Thirdly, when God raiſed Chriſt out of the Graue, hee is ſaid to beget his Sonne, for ſo the words of the ſecond Pſalme: <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee,</hi> are applyed to the Reſurrection of CHRIST<note n="e" place="margin">

                  <p>Firſt, concerning the Members, theſe things may be gathered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That not onely wicked men, but the true members of Chriſt die, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.

                  <p n="2">2 The gouernment of Chriſt reacheth as well to the dead as to the liuing Members. This the faithfull were wont of old to note, when they would ſay a man were dead, they would ſay, he was <hi>ioyn'd to his people.</hi> This ſhould bee a great encouragement vnto godly men to die.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From Coherence; that if wee would haue Chriſt to bee <hi>the firſt begotten</hi> to vs when wee are <hi>dead,</hi> wee muſt ſubiect our ſelues to his Ordinances, that hee may be the <hi>beginning</hi> of true Grace to vs while we liue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning the Head, theſe three things may be noted:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That hee <hi>was among the dead,</hi> and this was good for vs: for thereby hee diſſolued the power the Diuell had to inflict death, or the feare of it, vpon his Members<note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb:</hi> 2.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.</note>, and thereby hee finiſhed the expiation of all our ſinnes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee ratified Gods Couenant, thereby he kils the power of ſinne in vs, and thereby he takes away the curſe of our naturall death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That hee was not onely among the dead, but he was <hi>begotten among the dead,</hi> that is, raiſed from death to life; and this alſo was profitable for vs, for he <hi>roſe to our Iuſtification, Rom.</hi> 4, 23.24. to our <hi>viuification, Rom.</hi> 6.4. to our <hi>deliuerance from wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That hee is not onely begotten, but the <hi>firſt begotten among the dead;</hi> and that in three reſpects. Firſt; as hee was more excellently raiſed then any of the dead are; for hee carried no corruption to the graue; and <hi>hee ſaw no corruption</hi> in the graue, and hee was but a ſhort time vnder the power of the graue. Secondly, in reſpect of time; hee was the firſt that roſe from the dead<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 26.23.</note>. Thirdly, in reſpect of efficacie; it is hee by whoſe power all the reſt riſe<note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.22.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This muſt needes be a great comfort to vs while wee liue,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That in all things hee might haue the preheminence]</hi> Theſe words are added for further amplification or Explanation of the former. They giue vnto Chriſt a primacie and preheminence in all things: Firſt, ouer both liuing and dead: as hee is the beginning to the liuing, and the firſt begotten to the dead.

                  <p>It is to be noted in the generall, that the head ſhould excell the members in gifts: and therefore it is a fault in Cities, when the people chuſe vnto themſelues vnmeete men to be their Heads. God may chuſe <hi>Saul</hi> following his Fathers Aſſes, becauſe if he make Princes, he can giue ſpirit vnto Princes; but it is not ſo with men; they may giue the Office, but they cannot giue the gifts to execute it.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4894:103"/> Chriſt, it is well for his ſafety, againſt the malice of Sathan, who now may bite the heele, but cannot touch the head. And from hence we muſt learne, if we would euer get, by participation and influence, any grace from Chriſt, we muſt by Faith and effectuall calling, get into Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that hee ſaith, this <hi>Fulneſſe dwells in Chriſt;</hi> it notes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it: the perſonall Vnion ſhall neuer bee diſſolued, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the habituall graces of Chriſt, ſhall neuer bee aboliſhed. And theſe Graces had neede continue in him, for in him reſts the calling of the Elect, not yet gathered, and the perſeuerance of the Saints.</p>

God deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from heauen to earth, that man might aſcend from earth to heauen: God is made the Sonne of man, that man might be made the Sonne of God: hee that was rich became poore, to make vs rich; the immortall became mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, to make vs immortall.

                  <p>In the performance of this worke of Reconciliation or Mediation, there are ſix diſtinct things done by Chriſt: the firſt is <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> or <hi>Dijudication</hi> of the cauſe: hee takes notice of the ſtate and buſineſſe of the Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hee doth report the Will of God, the Couenant and Conditions of agreement with God, to the Church. Thirdly, hee makes Interceſſion for the offending party. Fourthly, hee ſatisfies and expiates for ſinne. Fiftly, hee applyes that Satisfaction. Sixtly, hee conſerues the Elect in the ſtate of Reconciliation. Diſcretion and Relation belong to the Propheticall office: Interceſſion and Satisfaction to the Preiſthood;<note place="margin">Who are not reconciled to God in Chriſt.</note> Application and Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to his Regall Office. Enquire then whether thou bee reconciled to God in Ieſus Chriſt. I conſider it negatiuely; thou art not reconciled, if thou bee not enlightened and inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, to lead thee into all truth. For if Chriſt did reconcile thee, as a Prophet, hee muſt teach thee both by his Word and Spirit. Againe, thou art not reconciled, if thou haue not conſecrated thy ſelfe to kill the beaſts, thy ſinnes, in ſacrifice before the Lord; and by the Spirit of Interceſſion, to powre out thy ſoule in Gods ſight. When Chriſt reconciles as a Prieſt, he powres vpon man <hi>the ſpirit of Compaſſion and Deprecation</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, the conſideration of the dignitie of Chriſts bloud ſhould teach Chriſtians to eſteeme their new birth. It is better to bee borne <hi>of the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> then of all the <hi>blouds of men</hi>

Secondly, to ſhew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of it: It is not poſſible to be ſaued, but by the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of CHRIST. Thirdly, to ſhew that all things in Chriſts action and Paſſion, were meritorious, leaſt men ſhould ſuperſtitiouſly dote or dreame vpon his Bloud, or the word of the Croſſe, or the ſigne of it, or the like. There is no merit in Bloud, but as it was in him. Fourthly, to conclude the worſhippe of Angels, which abuſe beganne then to grow among the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>On Earth.]</hi> Note here two things. Firſt, that eternall life is begunne in this life: wee ſhould neuer ſee Gods face in Heauen, if wee taſte not of his fauour on Earth. And if this muſt be begun on earth, why doe men deferre ſo great a worke as their reconciliation, as if it belong to heauen rather then to be done on earth; yea, this taxeth the ſlowneſſe of heart, and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Children, This knowledge, ioy, affection, &amp;c. is the ſame thou muſt haue in heauen. And wee ſhould learne hence, to liue on earth, like the Citizens of Heauen, Citizens will not liue ſo rudely as the Country Swaines, much more oddes ought there to be betweene <hi>Sarazens</hi> and <hi>Haga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> if I may ſo ſay; much difference betweene them that dwell in SION. and thoſe that haue no portion but in SINAY.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, where hee ſaith, <hi>vpon the Earth,</hi> and yet <hi>in Heauen,</hi> I might note the vncertainetie of our abode on earth: wee haue nothing to poſſeſſe but the outſide of the earth, which is ready to ſhake vs off daily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All things in Heauen.]</hi> For the meaning of theſe words, wee know,<note place="margin">Whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in Chriſt or no.</note> that there are in Heauen, both Angels and Saints. And it may bee queſtioned whether Angels be reconciled in Chriſt or no.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4894:106"/> not onely as head (for ſo hee is head of Angells) but as Mediator betweene parties fallen out. Whence wee may note two things: firſt, that the very Saints now in hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And beſides, it pounds to pieces merit of workes, inaſmuch as theſe Saints came not into heauen, but by the merits of Chriſt. Secondly, wee may learne that Chriſt merited not onely our perſons, but our grace and glory.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, that CHRIST is a true Head, to euery particular Church.</p>

And this wee may doe, both by furthering the Goſpell preached, and by <hi>ſeeking a holy ſeede;</hi> getting within the Couenant our ſelues, and by education, labouring to amend what by propagation we haue marred. Yea, the conſideration hereof; ſhould much encourage vs in the combate againſt Sinne and the World: for in the warre, Souldiers vſe to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit and valour vpon the tidings of new ſupplies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now.]</hi> Men are not reconciled till redemption bee applied: Chriſt dyed before, but they were not reconciled till now: It is not ſafe for men to reſt in the Hiſtoricall beliefe of Chriſts death: either learne to die to ſinne, to crucifie thy fleſh, and to take vp thy Croſſe daily, or elſe forbeare to mention CHRIST; for it is in vaine, thou haſt no part as yet in Chriſt.</p>

Gods rich fauour may ſtand with the many wants and infirmities of man: but then we muſt remember it is free and gracious: for if wee be perfectly reconciled and yet not perfectly ſanctified, then it muſt needes follow, wee are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled from our owne workes.</p>

No ſort of men can be happy, vntill they be reconciled: if men will not minde their peace, and ſue out their pardon in Chriſt, their hope will faile them; there is no other way to be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the words of Coherence: There remaines both their miſerie in this verſe, and the remedie of it in the next verſe.</p>

For the conſideration hereof ſhewes men the neede of a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4894:107"/> Sauiour, and as a Schoole-maſter traines them vp to Chriſt: it mollifies the ſtony hearts of men; it breedes watchfulneſſe ouer our nature, when wee know it is ſo poyſoned and corrupted: it makes vs compaſſionate ouer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their diſtreſſe or infirmities: it ſets an high price vpon ſpirituall things, and makes vs account Gods fauour our greateſt ioy: it makes vs cleaue to God in a perpetuall Couenant.

This ſhewes, as mans miſery, and death in ſinne, ſo the wonderfull mercy of God, in forgiuing ſuch ſins: It is a comfort, that ſinnes of ſet knowledge may bee forgiuen. And hence may be gathered a difference betweene the ſinnes of the regenerate,<note place="margin">Plena volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</note> and the ſinnes of the vnregenerate; for the godly ſinne not with a full minde, they are not ſet in euill; ſinne rebels in them, but not raignes.

                  <p>Firſt, there is no remedy for the ſinner, but the death of his Sauiour: how fooliſh mankinde hath beene diſtracted about the cure for their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is lamentable to conſider: <hi>Adam</hi> gets Figge-leaues, and Iſrael a fooliſh Couer<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, It is profitable to bee much in the meditation of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that it might ſincke into our minds, that we muſt goe out of ourſelues for happineſſe; and ſuch meditations open a way to godly ſorrow<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezec.</hi> 12.12.</note>.

And the thought of his ſufferings, may make vs willing to contemne the world, ſeeing heereby wee diſcerne that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world. Yea, wee owe vnto Chriſt the remembrance of his ſufferings. It is a ſmall thing he requires of vs, when he wils vs to thinke on him often, what he hath endured for vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In that body of his fleſh]</hi> Theſe words note Chriſts Nature: yet wee muſt conſider which Nature: in Chriſt there were two Natures in one perſon, perſonally vnited: his diuine and humane Nature. His diuine Nature was from Eternity, Immutable, Immortall, Impaſſible. His humane Nature, was conceiued, and borne in time; Mutable, Mortall, Paſſible; one and the ſame: <hi>without time</hi> begotten of the Father, the Sonne of God, without Mother; and <hi>in time</hi> borne of the Virgine, the Sonne of Man without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Sonne to both, Naturall and Conſubſtantiall. Theſe Natures are in one perſon, for, that God and Man might become one in Couenant; one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come God &amp; man in perſon. Theſe Natures are perſonally vnited: this vnion is perſonall, but not of perſons; and it is a vnion of Natures, not naturall.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Nature aſſumed, <hi>viz.</hi> his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. And there are two things to bee noted in theſe words.

In the vicious accidents of the ſubſtance of it, no ſinne, either could or ought to infect it: <hi>Could not;</hi> becauſe originall ſinne was reſtrained by the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Ought not,</hi> becauſe in it a <hi>purgation</hi> for our ſinnes muſt be made. In three things it was like ours: firſt, in ſubſtance, hee tooke our whole Nature; hee was the <hi>ſeede of the Woman,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In 3. things it was like.</note> the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> &amp;c. And hee tooke the parts of our Nature, both ſoule and body. 2.

And in the parts, as in the ſoule, hee aſſumed, Vnderſtanding, Will, Memory: and in the Body, Figure, Quantitie, and Circumſcription, &amp;c. 3. In infirmities, for hee aſſumed not onely our Nature, but the infirmities of Nature.

Firſt, in that in death hee ſuſtained not his owne perſon, but dyes as our ſurety, and ſo is a ſacrifice for ſinne. Secondly, hee was in death a <hi>whole burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;</hi> for as hee dyed in body, ſo his ſoule was <hi>an offering for ſinne,</hi> in as much as hee ſuſtained the ſence of the infinite wrath of God in his Agonies. Thirdly, in that his death was the death of him that was the Sonne of God. Hitherto of the doctrine, of the Nature and ſufferings of Chriſt, the Vſes follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Vſes of Chriſts death.</note>Firſt, for Inſtruction. The conſideration of all this ſhould teach vs, 1. to value reconciliation, with all the graces that flow from it, according to the worth of the meanes by which they are procured. If there were no other way to know the worth of Gods Fauour, Knowledge, Spirituall refreſhings, and Graces, yet by the price, payd for the purchaſe of them, wee may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne they are worth more then all the world. 2. Is it not poſſible for vs to hate ſinne, vpon the conſideration of ſo pregnant an example of the odiouſneſſe of it, when the imputation of ſinne brought the Sonne of God on his knees, to his death. <hi>O the ſoule Lethargie,</hi> that hath ouergrowen vs! 3. That wee may haue the profit of the Incarnation, and Paſſion of CHRIST, in his naturall body, wee muſt bee carefull to get into his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body. 4. The Apoſtle vſeth the Meditation of Chriſts humiliation to the death, as an argument to perſwade vs to Compaſſion, Mercy, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Spirit; Vnitie, Humility, Clemency, and meekneſſe of minde, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1. <hi>to</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wicked men may here ſee what ſmart they are like to feele from the vnpartiall iuſtice of God. Doth hee not ſpare the body, the fleſh, the bloud, the life, of his owne Sonne, when hee became but a ſurety for ſinne? How ſhall vngodly men, euer enemies, and neuer ſonnes, that themſelues haue committed ſinne, eſcape, when the day of wrath ſhall come?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, godly men may heere ſee great reaſon of comfort, not onely by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4894:109"/> conſidering the great loue of Chriſt, and the great benefits muſt needs flow from his death; but if two things bee weighed: 1. the honour done to our Nature, in that in the humanity of Chriſt it is ioyned to the diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This makes amends for that breach that is made by the damnation of millions, in our nature. 2. The great certainty of Gods couenant,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.7.</note> of Grace and Mercy. For <hi>a mans couenant, if it be once confirmed, no man abrogates it, or addeth, or taketh from it:</hi> therefore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9.</note> much more Gods Couenant ſhall ſtand vnchangeable, being ratified and confirmed by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the Meanes.</p>
                  <p>The end followes, in theſe words: <hi>To preſent you holy, and without ſpot, and vnblameable in his ſight.</hi> And in theſe words, is both the preſentation, and the ſanctification of Chriſtians to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To preſent you.]</hi> The originall word is very ſignificant, and diuerſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: it ſignifies to reſtore: ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 9.41. to aſſemble, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.26. to make preſent: ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 23.23. to make ready, furniſh, purge, or make cleane, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.24. to make acceptable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 8. to make manifeſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. to proue euidently, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.13. to aſſiſt, and ſtand too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. to offer by way of dedication, or gift to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28.</p>
                  <p>It is true that Chriſt reſtores vs, collects vs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6.</note> brings vs into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, clenſeth vs, makes vs acceptable, aſſiſts, and defends vs, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts vs to be holy. But I take it principally in the laſt ſence, hee preſents vs by dedication to God. Thus Chriſt ſhall preſent vs wholly, both at the day of iudgement<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10.</note>, and in the day of death, when hee ſhall deliuer the ſoule to God. Thus alſo Chriſt doth preſent vs in this life: 1. When by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell, hee ſeuers and ſegregates vs from the world, and brings vs into Gods houſhold. 2. In Iuſtification, when clothing vs with his owne righteouſneſſe, hee becomes our Iuſtification. 3. In new obedience: and that two wayes: firſt, when hee preſents our workes, couered with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. Secondly, when hee cauſeth vs to preſent our ſelues to GOD, both by Prayer and conſecration of our ſelues to Gods Seruice, and holines of life. It muſt bee euery mans care then to ſeeke his preſentation from Chriſt, and to that end, by Couenant, Prayer, and practiſe, deuote himſelfe to a ſubiection, to all the ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus of Preſentation: Sanctification followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Holy, vnblameable, and vnreproueable in his ſight.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the words are to be vnderſtood</note>] At the firſt ſight I ſhould encline to vnderſtand theſe words, either of Iuſtification, or our conſummate holineſſe at the day of iudgement; but that the ſway of Interpreters force me to expound them of Sanctification. It is greatly to bee waighed, that a man in this life ſhould be here ſayd to be holy, vnblameable, and vnreproue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or as the other Tranſlation hath it, without fault in his ſight. For the better conceiuing of it, wee muſt compare with theſe words, other Scripture, wherein is giuen vnto the godly, that they haue cleane hands, and a pure heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.4. that they are pure, <hi>Prou.</hi> 21.8. vpright in heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. ſanctified throughout, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. perfect,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 8:61.</note> or vndefiled in their way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1. perfect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. faultleſſe, <hi>Iud.</hi> 24. without ſpot, and blameleſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. walking in all Gods wayes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.58. and that they keepe Gods couenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 78.8.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 132.22. Thus <hi>Noah</hi> is ſayd to be perfect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9 <hi>Ezekiah</hi> walked before God, with a perfect heart, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38. <hi>Dauids</hi> heart was perfect, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were both righteous before God, and walking in all the commandements of the Lord blameleſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion is, how thoſe ſayings ſhould bee true, and in what ſence they are meant: And for the cleering of the doubt, the way is not ſimply to reiect the propoſitions, as impious, and vntrue, and hereticall, as ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4894:110"/> and malicious perſons doe: but ſeeing they are the ſacred words of Scripture, to conſider what it is may bee attained, and what Gods requires of vs. To thinke with the Papiſts, or Anabaptiſts, that any mortall man can performe the obedience required in the morall Law, perfectly; ſo as neuer to commit ſinne againſt the Law, is a moſt blaſphemous, deteſtable, and curſed opinion, for there is no man that ſinneth not: the beſt of the Saints haue had their thouſands of ſinne. But thoſe places are to bee vnderſtood of the righteouſneſſe of the Chriſtian, as hee is conſidered to bee vnder the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and the Goſpell, not of Legall perfection, but of an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall innocency and vprightneſſe. Not as their workes are in themſelues, but comparatiuely, either with the workes of wicked men, or as they are in their deſire and endeauour, and as they are preſented in the interceſſion of Chriſt, who couers th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes the faithfull are ſayd to be perfect, that is, ſtrong men in CHRIST; compared with the weake Chriſtian, and Infant in grace: ſo that wee ſee what a Chriſtian in this life may attaine vnto; the rigour of the Law being taken away, in the couenant of grace, and the imperfections of his workes, and frailty, being couered in Chriſts inteceſſion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is occaſioned diuerſly. Firſt, ſometime for want of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct direction, or carefull examination, about the application of the ſignes of Gods fauor: ſome Chriſtians haue not the ſignes cleerly &amp; diſtinctly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: others that haue them, &amp; know the vſe of them, grow ſloathfull and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4894:113"/> negligent, and are iuſtly ſcourged with the want of the glory of this eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſometimes it comes to paſſe, for want of vſing priuate meanes more conſcionably; as Reading, Prayer, or Conference.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſo ſometimes with Chriſtians, becauſe of ſome ſinne they lye in, without repentance; there may be ſome ſinne, which they too much fauour; and are loath to forſake, whether it be ſecr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, or more open.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Vnfruitfulneſſe, and barrenneſſe in good workes may cauſe it: for if Faith did beare fruit vpwards, it would take roote downewards.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, many are grieuouſly preſſed, vnder legall perfection, being not able diſtinctly to diſcerne the benefit of the Couenant of grace, in freeing them from the curſe, and rigour of the Law. The ignorance of this one point, hath, and doth couer the faces and hearts of millions of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, with a perplexed confuſion, and feare without cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, many profeſſors liue in much vnreſt, for want of diſcerning things that differ, and the right vſe of Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, there is a kinde of luke-warmeneſſe in practiſe, after hearing, which is in many ſcourged with the withholding of this rich grace of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtedfaſtneſſe. I ſay, luke-warmeneſſe in practiſe: for it may bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that many heare with great affection, and continue to be ſtirring, in expreſſing their liking of the Word, and yet are exceedingly negligent in the conſcionable and daily practiſe of ſuch rules, as in the miniſterie of the Word they ſeeme to receiue with admiration, and great liking.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, this comes by reaſon of the want of patience, and a meeke ſpirit: ſome Chriſtians are froward, paſſionate, tranſported with violent affections, either of anger, or worldly griefe: and theſe ſeldome or neuer, gaine any long reſt, or continuall contentment: troubled affections, greatly hinder ſetledneſſe, euen in the beſt things.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, many profeſſors reuolt to the world, and giue themſelues to an vniuſtifiable liberty, in following either their profits, or their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. And therefore no maruell, though Grace and true Religion, thriue ſo ſlowly in them, when they eate vp their hearts and liues with theſe cares and delights of life.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of Faith. Now of Hope.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Though by Faith wee are interreſſed in Gods fauour, and our ſoules gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed on earth with diuers graces, as the fruits of Faith, and our liues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected with caeleſtiall priuiledges; yet the glory of our kingdome is neither of this world, nor in this world. Hope muſt guide vs to future things, as well as Faith to preſent: and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth with great reaſon teach vs to <hi>bleſſe God,</hi> for <hi>begetting vs againe to a liuely hope</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</note>: our whole hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe may be branched out into theſe two parts. Firſt, what wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready on earth; and ſecondly, what wee looke to haue hereafter in Heauen. The one, Faith procures, the other, Hope aſſures. Now in that wee haue not all our happineſſe here, but hope for it elſewhere, it ſhould teach vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wee ſhould effectually pray vnto GOD to giue ſuch ſound <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and reuelation,</hi> by his word and ſpirit, <hi>that wee may indeede know this hope of our calling</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph:</hi> 1.18.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in all troubles, wee ſhould bee the more patient, ſeeing wee holde our full and finall deliuerance (when wee ſhall feele no more troubles or croſſes) by Hope. Perfect ſaluation is had here onely by Hope<note n="p" place="margin">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4894:113"/> that were to proclaime our want of knowledge, or want of ſenſe and feeling, in the thoughts of the happineſſe of another world<note n="q" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13.</note>.

                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">

                  <p>The Vſe is two-fold: firſt, it may reproue that vnſetledneſſe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is found in men, in the times of their affliction, when euery croſſe can moue them away from their confidence. We would think him a ſtrange man, that in time of peace, would walke vp and downe with a Helmet on him, and when hee were to go into any battell, or fray, in the middeſt of the fight, when it was at the hotteſt, would take his Helmet, and throw it off him. And yet ſo ſtrange are we. In proſperitie wee out-bragge all men with our hope in God, and our ſtrong confidence; but when the Diuell, or the World, beginne to deale their blowes, and to moleſt vs with ſharpeſt aſſaults, then we grow heartleſſe, or impatient, and throw away our hope, when wee haue moſt neede of it. Secondly, it ſhould teach vs to labour after this vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of hope; which, that it may the better be done, two things are to be looked to. 1. that our hope be a true hope: 2. that we vſe the meanes to make this hope vnmoueable.</p>
                  <p>And for the firſt, wee muſt conſider three things. Firſt, what hope is not true hope. Secondly, what perſons haue no hope. Thirdly, what are the effects or properties of true hope. Some things of many, in each of theſe, ſhall be inſtanced in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a hope, of which men ſhall one day bee aſhamed: ſuch is,<note place="margin">What hope is not true hope.</note> mens hope in their riches<note n="x" place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, there are many ſorts of men in the world, concerning whom it is plaine in Scriptures, they haue not hope. For in the generall, there is no hope in any vnregenerate man<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1:3. <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 2:12.</note>; and in particular it is cleere, there is no true hope; Firſt, in the ignorant, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 9.10. Secondly, in prophane men, that make no conſcience of ſinne, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 115.11. Thirdly, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, that <hi>bleſſe their hearts againſt the curſes of the Law, Deuter.</hi> 29.19. Fourthly, in the <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> for though hee haue wouen to himſelfe, out of the bowels of his poiſonous breaſt, a faire webbe of hope, yet <hi>it ſhall be as the houſe of the Spider,</hi> one ſwope of Gods Beeſome ſhall eaſily lay him and his hope in the duſt of miſerie<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 8.13.</note>. Laſtly, it is not <hi>in workers of iniquitie,</hi> that make a Trade of ſinne, and euery day plodde about miſchiefe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, true hope is moſt ſtirring in affliction, and then it ſhewes it ſelfe by foure things.<note place="margin">Which are the effects or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of true hope.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, By Profeſſion: it will not onely know, but <hi>acknowledge that truth, which is according to godlines</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.2.</note>. It will confeſſe, &amp; profeſſe; wheras the common hope, ſeldome, or neuer at any time, holds it conuenient to be ſo forward.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:4894:114"/>
                  <p>Secondly, by Abnegation; for it will endure ſcornes, loſſes, temptations, oppoſitions, &amp;c. It is not moued away by the carnall reaſons of the fleſh; the diſdaine of carnall friends; the violence of vnreaſonable aduerſaries, or the like: the chaine will not feare it, nor the reproach ſhame it<note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</note>. It will be buſie, though it haue no thanke for his labour<note n="g" place="margin">

                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.15.16.</note>: Whereas the common hope is frighted with the noyſe of a chaine, and put out of countenance with a ſcoffe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: it will ſpeake CHRIST faire, but looſe nothing for his ſake: it likes preaching well, but it will neuer beleeue it is ſo as the Preacher ſayes: it loues GOD aboue all, but yet it muſt haue a care to ſee to it, at any hand, that ſuch and ſuch friends be not diſpleaſed: it will be better aduiſed then to be in danger of ſuch and ſuch troubles. And if it be hard beſtead, it will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſend to a Wizard, to vſe now and then a lye, or an oath, or a little fraud, and falſe dealing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by Mortification: <hi>Hee that hath this hope, purgeth himſelfe, that he may be pure, as Chriſt is pure</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</note>. It ſtirreth vp to much praier, confeſſion, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, faſting, and ſpirituall reuenge. Hee that hath moſt hope, is moſt in the humiliation of his ſoule.

                     <hi>Which was preached vnto euery Creature vnder Heauen.]</hi> Theſe words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the firſt reaſon, and it ſtands thus: In as much as the doctrine taught you, is the ſame Doctrine that hath beene taught to, and receiued by all the Elect; therefore yee ought to continue in it, and neuer be mooued from the Grace wrought by it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Some vnderſtand the meaning to be this: that the Apoſtle intends to note, by the preaching of the Goſpell to euery Creature, onely thus much;<note place="margin">How the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to euery creature.</note> That it was now no more confined in <hi>Iudea,</hi> but was publiſhed to Gentiles as well as Iewes: and ſo it was preached to euery Creature, in as much as all mankinde had as much intereſt as the Iewiſh Nation. Others thinke the ſpeech imports no more, but that the fame of the Goſpell was ſpred by the Marchants and other that lay at <hi>Rome, Ieruſalem,</hi> and other great Cities, vnto all knowen Countries of the world. Others thinke it is no more then if hee had ſayd, it was publiſhed farre and wide: as in <hi>Iohn</hi> they ſay, <hi>the whole world goeth after him;</hi> but they meane a great multitude; an vſuall Hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpeech. Laſtly, others thinke, that when he ſaith, it was preached, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it ſhould be preached to euery creature; the time paſt being put for the time to come, to import, that it ſhall as certainely be done, as if it had beene done already. But I take, it is meant of the preaching of the Goſpell by the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, in the conuerſion of ſo many Nations to the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There may bee ſeuen Obſeruations gathered out of this ſpeech of the Apoſtle. Firſt, that Doctrine onely is true which is agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles, by which the world was conuerted to God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee may ſee that no power is like the power of the Word of God: heere it conuerts a world in a ſhort time: And our eyes haue behelde that it hath almoſt in as ſhort time reſtored a world of men from the power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. Thirdly, we may by this phraſe bee enformed, that the words, <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>euery one,</hi> are not alwayes in Scripture to bee vnderſtood vniuerſally, of all the ſingular perſons in the world, as the Vniuerſaliſts conceiue. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were but a few Fiſher-men that did this great worke, and they were much oppoſed and perſecuted, and in ſome leſſe matters they iarred ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time among themſelues. Whence wee may obſerue, that Doctrine may bee exceeding effectuall, though 1. but few teach it; 2. though they bee but of meane eſtate and condition; 3. though it be oppoſed by croſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary teaching; 4. though it be perſecuted; 5. though the people be in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and nuzled in ſinne and ſuperſtition, as theſe Gentiles were; 6. though the Preacher be often reſtrained; 7. though there be ſome diſſention in leſſe matters. The fift thing that may be gathered hence, is, that in the conuerſion of ſinners, God is no reſpecter of perſons; men of any age, nation, ſex, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, life or quality, may bee conuerted by the Goſpell. And ſixtly, it is plaine heere, that preaching is the ordinary meanes to conuert euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo as ordinarily there is none conuerted but by preaching. Laſtly, if any one aske what ſhall become of thoſe nations, or particular perſons, that neuer yet heard of the Goſpell; I anſwer, the way of God in diuers things
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4894:115"/> is not reuealed; and his Iudgements are like a great deepe: It belongs to vs to looke to our ſelues, to whom the Goſpell is come.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from the teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> and hee giues a double teſtimony; 1. By his Miniſtery; 2. By his Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherof I Paul am a miniſter.]</hi> Out of theſe words many things may be noted:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that the Apoſtle, notwithſtanding all the diſgraces and troubles that befell him for the Goſpell, doth yet lift vp the mention of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery therein, as an inducement to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> It may teach vs, that the glory of Gods truth is ſuch, as no man neede to bee aſhamed to teach or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, nay, there can be no man or woman, to whom it may not bee their cheifeſt glory, whatſoeuer carnall worldlings or timerous <hi>Nicodemites</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that ſo great an Apoſtle doth not diſdaine to yeelde his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, of purpoſe to ſhew that <hi>Epaphras</hi> their Preacher had taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what hee had likewiſe taught: it ſheweth that it is the property of faithfull and humble Miniſters to ſtrengthen the harts and hands of their Brethren; though they be their inferiours, and then it will follow, that they are proud, and enuious, and malicious perſons, that by croſſe teaching la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to encreaſe their bonds, whom God hath honoured with ſucceſſe in their labours in the Goſpell: ſuch are they, that in many places ſtriue to pull downe as faſt as others builde, making hauocke in the Church, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their whole might in their Miniſtery to hinder the ſincerity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and the conuerſion of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that the Apoſtle vrgeth his owne teſtimonie, <hi>[I Paul,]</hi> it ſheweth that the teſtimony of one Apoſtle is better then a thouſand others; One <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed to many falſe Teachers: which ſhould teach vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe much in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets (which are of like authority.) And the rather, becauſe the beſt of other men may erre; nay, haue erred: and therefore a heape of humane teſtimonies ſhould bee of no value againſt one Scripture. And as the people ſhould try the Spirit by this witneſſe, ſo ſhould Preachers make conſcience of it, to take more paines to enforme the conſciences of the people, by the teſtimony of the Word, then by humane authority, of what ſort ſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in that heere is but one <hi>Paul,</hi> that comes in, to confirme the truth of the Goſpell, it ſhewes that many times the ſoundeſt Teachers are the feweſt in number. Heere it is ſo in the beſt times of the Church: ſo it was before; there was but one <hi>Michaiah</hi> for foure hundred falſe Prophets: ſo in Chriſts time there was a ſwarme of Phariſaicall, proud, vaine glorious, hypocriticall, ſilken Doctours, that loued the cheefe roome, and ſought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, teachers of liberty and ſtrife, defenders of traditions, and their owne glory and greatneſſe, when Chriſt and his Diſciples were by their enuy ſcorned, as a few preciſe ſingular fellowes.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, in that the Apoſtle ſtileth himſelfe by the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> and not of <hi>Saul,</hi> it may intimate that men truely regenerate hate the vaine name of their vnregeneracy: it is a foule ſigne when men can glory in the titles and names of their lewdneſſe and ſinne paſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in that the Apoſtle tearmeth himſelfe a Deacon, (for ſo the word tranſlated <hi>Miniſter,</hi> is in the originall) it notes his great humilitie: it was a happy time in the Church, when the Apoſtles called themſelues Deacons: and then beganne the Church to decay in true glory, when Deacons would needes be Apoſtles.</p>

                     <hi>And fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Chriſt.]</hi> Some of the late Papiſts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from theſe words, that CHRIST did not ſuffer all that was needefull for mans deliuerance from ſinne, but left a deale to bee ſuffered by his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, eſpecially men of principall note: and hence grew their <hi>Supererogation, Satisfactory paines,</hi> and <hi>Indulgences.</hi> But that this cannot bee the meaning of this place, is cleere, firſt, becauſe that doctrine is contrary to other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4.5.6.8.10.11.12. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>to</hi> 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.25.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. Secondly, themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudges, this ſenſe brings in a groſſe abſurditie: for if the words bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the ſuffering Chriſt left to his people to endure, for ſatisfaction for ſinne, then it will follow, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered all was wanting, and ſo there ſhould remaine none for any other to ſuffer; for hee ſaith, <hi>hee ſuffered the reſt of the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Fulk</hi> ſay, that none of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did heere thus vnderſtand the words:<note place="margin">Auguſt. tract. <hi>84.</hi> in Iohn.</note> and it is plaine, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is flat againſt this ſenſe, when hee ſaith, <hi>Though Brethren die for Brethren, yet no bloud of Martyrs is ſhed for remiſſion of ſinnes: this Chriſt onely hath done.</hi> And <hi>Leo,</hi> a Pope, could ſay, <hi>The iuſt receiue, not giue Crownes.</hi> And out of the fortitude of the faithfull, ariſe examples of Patience, not gifts of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.

Fiftly, their Schoole-Diuines are againſt them; the Gloſſe hath it thus, <hi>Provobis,</hi> i. <hi>Confirmandis in doctrina Euangelij.

And the reaſon why ſome of Gods Seruants are ſo vnmooueable in their croſſes, is, becauſe they conuerſe in heauen, and their ſpirits walke with God, and ſo are without reach of theſe earthly perturbations. Beſides, when a mans heart is ſettled and grounded in the truth, and in the aſſurance of Gods loue, what ſhould diſquiet his ſoule that knoweth nothing to mourne for but ſinne, and the abſence of God? and nothing ioyous, but what comes from the light of Gods countenance?</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, we may heere note the wonderfull loue and compaſſion of Chriſt, that pittieth not onely our ſoules but our fleſh, accounting what wee ſuffer, to be as his ſufferings.

                     <note place="margin">Two kindes of ſufferings: 1. of the Church; 2. for the Church.</note>
                     <hi>For his bodyes ſake, which is the Church.]</hi> Sufferings are of two kindes: Eyther, <hi>of the Church;</hi> or <hi>for the Church. Of the Church,</hi> are alſo of two kindes: Eyther, <hi>Chaſtiſements,</hi> or <hi>Trials.</hi> Sufferings <hi>for the Church</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of two ſorts: Eyther, <hi>Expiation,</hi> and ſo Chriſt onely ſuffered; or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi> for confirmation of Doctrine, or encouragement in practiſe, and ſo the Saints haue ſuffered for the Church.</p>
                  <p>The principall Doctrine from hence is, that the particular ſufferings of Gods Seruants, eſpecially the Miniſters, ſerue for the good and profit of the whole body.<note place="margin">Vſes.</note> The Vſe is manifold: Firſt, wee ſhould heereby bee enformed to minde the good of the Church, and to ſeeke the aduancement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the good of religious perſons, aboue our owne eſtate. Our care ſhould bee moſt for the body of Chriſt, and wee ſhould reioyce in any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice wee could doe to the Church of God. Secondly, ſuch as are called to ſuffer, ſhould labour to ſhew all good faithfulneſſe, zeale, conſtancy, and holy diſcretion, ſeeing their ſufferings concerne more then their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Thirdly, this ſhould ſtirre vs vp to pray for ſuch as are in trouble for good cauſes, ſince their afflictions are ſome way for our ſakes<note n="t" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</note>. Fourthly, this may encourage poore Chriſtians, that complaine they haue not meanes to doe good; they may be hence enformed, that if God call them thereunto, they may doe good, yea, to the whole Church, by their ſufferings: no wants can hinder, but that the pooreſt Chriſtian may profit others, by prayer, faſtings, counſell, admonitions, comfort and ſuffering. Fiftly, ſince the ſufferings of the righteous are for our confirmation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee ſhould vſe the meditation of ſuch ſufferings, when wee finde our ſelues inclineable to diſcouragement, or impatiency, or doubting. Laſtly, this greatly reprooues carnall Chriſtians, which are ſo taken vp generally with the care of their naturall bodies, that they haue vtterly neglected the care and ſeruice of the myſticall Body. And in as much as men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo barraine in doing good, it is a plaine ſigne there is no hope that euer they would ſuffer for God.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:4894:117"/>
                  <p>Secondly, further hence may be noted, that the Doctrine or ſufferings of the Saints, are no priuiledge or benefit to any but the true Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Papiſts haue no cauſe to boaſt of <hi>Peter</hi> and the Saints, ſo long as they remaine a falſe Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may alſo obſerue hence, that they only are of the true Church, who are of the body of Chriſt; and therefore we muſt be ſure, we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, before we glad our hearts with our priuiledge in the Church. And a member of Chriſt thou art not, vnleſſe, 1.<note place="margin">Who are members of Chriſt.</note> thou beleeue the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thy ſinnes; for we are ingrafted onely by Faith: 2. Vnleſſe thou haue had in thy ſoule an influence of holy graces from Chriſt, as from the head: 3. Vnleſſe thou <hi>worke the workes of Chriſt,</hi> and bring foorth the fruits of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed life; for thereby thou muſt try whether thou bee a true plant in this Vine. And laſtly, if thou be of this body, thou haſt ſome roome in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Gods Children, or elſe it will be hard to prooue that thou art a fellow member.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here wee may ſee, that ſeldome comes there any good to the Church, but there is ſuffering for it; it cannot be redeemed but Chriſt muſt dye: and if the merit of this Redemption be applied, <hi>Paul</hi> muſt dye. It is an ill ſigne thou haſt no true grace, when thou ſuffereſt nothing for the grace thou truſteſt to: It is an ill ſigne that God is not with the Watch men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when they ſuffer nothing for the efficacie of their doctrine. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may any thinke this may be preuented by meekeneſſe or wiſedome, for the treaſures of both theſe were in Chriſt, and yet hee was a <hi>man full of ſorrowes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for concluſion,<note place="margin">Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Croſſe.</note> out of the whole Verſe wee may gather together a number of Arguments againſt the Croſſe: 1. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffers: 2. One may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, notwithſtanding afflictions: 3. The longer wee beare the croſſe, the better able wee ſhall be to endure it; this may bee gathered out of the word <hi>[Now.]</hi> 4. They are ſuch as Chriſt accounts his: 5. They come from the decree of God: 9. Their meaſure is ſet by God: 7. Wee beare them but in our courſe, others haue gone before vs, and after vs muſt others follow: 8. Chriſt ſuffered the great brunt of Gods wrath; our ſufferings are but ſmall reliques, or parcels, that are left behinde. 9. The meaſure will once be full, and that ſhortly: 10. They are but in the fleſh for the moſt part: 11. Chriſt reſpects the troubles of our fleſh, as well as the affliction of our ſpirit: 12. Wee may profit the Church by our ſufferings.</p>

                  <p>From the generall conſideration of the whole Verſe, I obſerue, both the dignitie and the reſtraint of the Miniſtery.

The reſtraint is likewiſe in three things: firſt, hee is a Miniſter or Seruant; not a Lord or Sauiour: ſecondly, he receiues his commandement from God: he muſt not runne of his owne head, nor hold his office by meere humane ordination: thirdly, the word of God muſt be his ground and rule, for all his dealing, in diſpenſing the things of God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To fulfill the word of God.</hi> Diuers things may be hence obſerued. Firſt, the Word is that ſpeciall treaſure, and the chiefe portion that God hath left, both to Miniſters and People. Secondly, whatſoeuer the word ſeemeth to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to carnall men, yet it is certaine, God will ſee to it, that all that is in it ſhall <hi>be fulfilled.</hi> Thirdly, the Preachers of the Goſpell, are the meanes to ſet the word a working. And therefore no wonder, though troupes of people that are not ſubiect to the miniſtery of the word, finde little power it it. Beſides, it euidently confutes thoſe that thinke by reading at home, to get enough both for knowledge and ſaluation: for it is preaching that by Gods bleſſing and ordination doth put life into the word, and brings it into accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may wee conceiue of it,<note place="margin">How the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters fulfill the Word.</note> that Gods Miniſters do fulfill the word? <hi>Anſ.</hi> The word is ſaid by them to bee fulfilled foure waies: 1. if we reſpect preaching it ſelfe: 2. if wee reſpect the manner of preaching: 3. if we reſpect the ſuffering that followes preaching: 4. if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the efficacie of preaching.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: <hi>Paul</hi> may be ſaid to fulfill the word, in that he doth preach, as he was by his commiſſion appointed; he was charged by God to preach, and in obedience to Gods word or will, hee did preach it. It is not enough for Miniſters to receiue commiſſion to preach, but they muſt <hi>fulfill it:</hi> and therefore woe to thoſe Loyterers, and Non-ſidents, that care more to fill their barnes, then to fulfill their miniſtration.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond: Miniſters are ſaid to fulfill the word, when they execute their Commiſſion in a due manner: and this they doe; firſt, when they preach with all diligence: ſecondly, when they hold out to the end, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king paines for a Sermon or two, or a yeere or two, till they can get prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with all conſtancy, perſeuering in the labour and worke of their Miniſtry, till their <hi>courſe be ended,</hi> and the <hi>fight finiſhed</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, Miniſters fulfill the Word by afflictions, for thereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the hearts of their hearers: as alſo, thereby is fulfilled vpon them that which is in Scripture ſo oft fore-told, ſhould befall the faithfull diſpenſers of the word<note n="a" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in reſpect of the efficacie of the word, it is fulfilled by them; for many great things, threatned or promiſed in the word, were to bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by them, ſome extraordinary, ſome ordinary. The extraordinary, were bound to certaine times, ſuch as were heretofore, the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the induration or obſtinacie of the Iewes; and ſuch as are now in doing, or to be done, as the reclayming of the world, by the euerlaſting Goſpell, the downefall of Antichriſt, and the gathering of the Iewes: Theſe things haue beene promiſed in the word, and haue, are, and ſhall be, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully fulfilled by the miniſtry of Preachers. The ordinary are fulfilled in the Church at all times: and thus the Word is fulfilled in the elect, and in the reprobate. In the elect, Miniſters fulfill the Word; 1. In conuerting thoſe by the word, which were <hi>fore-ordained of God</hi>

                        <hi>Rom:</hi> 1:16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.19.</note>. 2. In conueying Chriſt to their ſoules: ſo as the word is not a bare hiſtory of the merit, and grace of Chriſt, but is fulfilled in the application of Chriſt<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal:</hi> 3:1:3:5.</note>. 3. By <hi>diuiding the word amongst them,</hi> as the food of their ſoules, to preſerue them. 4. By the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Promiſes, which are effectually in the Miniſtery fulfilled in the hearts of the hearers<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 4:21.</note>. Laſtly, in cauſing the Elect to fulfill the Word, both in obeying the Word<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.18.</note>, and in perſeuering in the doctrine to the end. In the Reprobate they fulfill the Word: 1. In hardening them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. 2. By making them inexcuſable by illumination: 3. In occaſioning many ſinnes through their owne wilfull corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. 4. In ſlaying them, or by ſentence cutting them off, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe of all this is: 1. To ſhew the neceſſitie of continuall preaching, ſeeing by it, the word muſt be fulfilled: many are ſtill to be conuerted, and all to be comforted, directed, ſtrengthened, reproued, &amp;c. 2. To iuſtifie the continuall trauaile of faithfull Miniſters, that will neuer giue ouer to exhort, reproue, conuince, &amp;c. They are enioyned to ſee the word of God fulfilled, and therefore no wonder though they will not let men reſt in their ſinne and ſecuritie. 3. To teach vs in all temptations or afflictions, to run to the word preached, for thereby God will certainely performe all needfull conſolation, or direction, or humiliation. 4 To informe Miniſters, that they muſt adde indefatigable paines, ſince ſo much is to be fulfilled by them. 5. To admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſtubborne ſinners, to take heed of prouoking God, for if the word may not be fulfilled in their ſaluation, it ſhall be fulfilled in their induration.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, wee may hereby bee informed concerning the neceſſitie of preaching: the greater the Myſterie is, the greater need of laborious and ſtudious men, that are thereunto ſet apart, to make manifeſt thoſe ſecrets of the Kingdome: for this is the <hi>appointment of God our Sauiour, that by preaching committed to certaine men,</hi> thereunto ſanctified, (as the Apoſtle ſaith,) <hi>the word promiſed before the world beganne, ſhould be manifeſted in due time</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, the tranſitory eſtate of the world may heere be noted: the things of the world in their beſt frame are ſo mutable, that they expire and are altered with varieties, and the men of the world haue but their ſhort time, and then they goe out and leaue their roomes to their ſucceeding generation; which may ſerue for diuers vſes, if it be ſeriouſly thought on.

Fourthly, this may abate the great opinion of the wiſedome of this world: for what ſhall it profit mee to haue great skill to get money and meanes for this life, if I haue no skill or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for the ſauing of my ſoule? What ſhal it aduantage me to haue a nature and carriage, tilled and fitted for the winning of friends for this world, if I know not how to make mee friends for a better world? what auaileth it to haue gifts for an eminent place in mans Common-wealth, and for want of grace bee not acknowledged of the <hi>Common-wealth of Iſrael?</hi> to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4894:121"/> is it to be <hi>a Diſputer of this world,</hi> and in the day of Chriſt to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp with amazed ſilence, as not hauing a word to ſay for thy poore ſoule? And yet prouidence for our future eſtate may be learned from theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world. For if the Children of ſinne, be ſo induſtrious to make ſhift for their time, how much more ſhould the hearts of the Children of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie be enlarged to an inflamed care of large prouiſion for their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eſtate? Fiftly, this ſhould embolden vs to a willing forſaking of our ſelues, in the worſt of all outward trialls, which is, <hi>to forgoe euen all for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpells,</hi> if wee be put to it. What great thing is it to part with that little <hi>All</hi> that we haue in this world, ſeeing it could ſerue vs but for a little time; and at length wee muſt leaue all? and beſides, by a voluntary abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee ſhall be aduantaged in the gaine of an eternall recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a hundred-fold better.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, in that the Goſpell is hid from whole Ages and Generations of men, wee may ſee that whole multitudes may be in a miſerable eſtate; and that it is no priuiledge for any in ſinning, that many are ſuch ſinners. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is multitude, or ſucceſſion of men, in one minde for matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any note of the true Church. For here are whole ages, and many ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men, that all liued and died without the knowledge of the Goſpell: it is a ſlender prop for Faith to reſt on, to ſay our Fathers, and fore-fathers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> liued and died in this or that minde or opinion. Further, wee may obſerue hence the infectiouſneſſe of ſinne: how naturally it will ſpread, euen to the poiſoning of whole Worlds of men. If ſinne but once get a fountaine, if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lord ſtoppe it not, into what riuers of contagion will it defuſe it ſelfe? Alſo, we may ſee how fearefull a thing it is to fall into the hands of an angry God, ſince the liues of ſo many millions cannot finde pitty or pardon with him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And the inſenſibleneſſe of ſinners may hence be noted alſo. When would thoſe ages and generations of men haue awaked out of their idolatrous ſleepe, if the Lord by the voice of his Sonne, and his Seruants, had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked them? Moreouer, it may be manifeſt from hence, that the Lord in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> diſpencing his grace, is not moued by any outward things: for what can any perſon or people haue to commend them by to God, which thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had not? Laſtly, we may here ſee it verified, that Gods iudgements are like a great deepe: it is not for man to conceiue that hee ſhould be able to ſearch into them. Yet leaſt any ſhould ſtand ſtill, and be ſwallowed vp with amazement, at the fall and ruine of thoſe worlds of men, let him conſider of theſe things following.

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.</note>. Secondly, that theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deſertions, and exquiſite iudgements, were deſerued by an infinite mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of horrible ſinnes: which if wee could ſoundly conſider of, our Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about their falls would be much dulled. Thirdly, that it is God that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and deſcribeth Iuſtice: and therefore things are iuſt, becauſe he doth them; not that firſt man muſt pronounce them iuſt, and then God will doe them. Fourthly, that the reaſons of this dealing may bee iuſt, though not expreſt vnto vs. Fiftly, that Chriſtians are charged to be wiſe to ſobrietie: they may not let their thoughts runne as farre as they will, but muſt let God alone with his ſecret iudgements.

                  <p>Secondly, that the ſeaſons of the reuelation of the Goſpell, in the power of it, are ſingular priuiledges, and greatly to be heeded, and therefore woe is to thoſe ſoules that neglect ſuch <hi>dayes of grace,</hi> it is double condemnation.

This holy man cannot fall vpon the mention of the Goſpell, but his affections burſt out into great tearmes of Admiration, as if he thirſted after varietie of words to expreſſe his inward eſtimation: and as it is a ſigne of a ſanctifying diſpoſition to be ſo affected; ſo, when we ſee holy men ſtriuing for wordes to expreſſe the glory of ſpirituall things, it may ſecretly condemne the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and barrainneſſe of our dull ſpirits, that vſually through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, proue to haue the dulleſt affections, where wee ſhould bee moſt ſtirred: and the Apoſtle doth well in ſeeking theſe affecting tearmes, that ſo hee might excite affection and appetite in the hearers; for people will no longer profit by the word, then they admire it, and long after it with eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: and therefore it ſhould be a holy diſcretion in Miniſters, to ſtudy by all meanes to teach in ſuch a manner as might moſt ſtirre affection and iuſt admiration at the power and fitnes of the Word.

                  <p>IN this verſe is contained the ſixt generall Reaſon, taken from the end and profitable effect of the Goſpell. If they continue conſtant, by the power of the word, they will be made fit to be preſented in ſome meaſure of ripeneſſe and perfection, vnto God, in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Two things are in the verſe to be obſerued: the Meanes, and the End: the meanes is preaching; which is amplified by the parts of it, <hi>admoniſhing</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> and by the manner of it, <hi>in all wiſedome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whom we preach.]</hi> The reaſon why the Apoſtle falls ſo often into the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and praiſe of their preaching, is to reſcue it from the contempt, vnder which many times it lay diſgraced.</p>
                  <p>There are foure things may be obſerued here,<note place="margin">The honour of Miniſters.</note> which tend to expreſſe the honour of the miniſtery in this place. 1. They are as it were, the Lords high treaſurers, to diſpenſe the riches of the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt. And if ſuch an office bee in ſuch requeſt vnder earthly Princes, what is it to be ſo honoured of the Prince of all Princes? All the world is beholding to the miniſtery, for they ſhew that Mine of incomparable Treaſure; they dig it vp; they offer it as ſpirituall Merchants: yea, the Lord by them doth as it were, particularly inrich all Chriſtians. 2. This honour of publiſhing the Goſpell, is now taken from the very Angels, and giuen to them: now <hi>Wee,</hi> not the Angels, preach vnto you. 3. They haue the beſt ſubiect that euer men had to intreat of: all other Sciences are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> compariſon of them, they intreat of Chriſt, and grace, and glory for euer by him: nay, 4. herein differs preaching from all other relations whatſoeuer, that they doe not preach of Chriſt, but they preach CHRIST, that is, they giue what they ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>And theſe three little words expreſſe diuerſly the duty of Miniſters. 1.<note place="margin">The dutie of Miniſters.</note> they muſt preach, that is plaine. 2. they muſt preach diligently, which may bee gathered from the expreſſing of it in the preſent-tence: It was not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent excuſe, wee haue preached as diligently as any in our young times, or before we came to ſuch preferment: No, this muſt be the comfort of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and his continuall plea; wee doe preach; not, wee haue preached. 3. They muſt preach CHRIST, that is, that part of Diuinitie that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Redemption, Iuſtification, and Sanctification. 4. They muſt labour in preaching, to expreſſe as much as lies in them, conſent. Conſent, I ſay, with the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and conſent with their fellow Miniſters; <hi>Wee,</hi> not I, there is one only truth for all Miniſters to teach. 5. They muſt reſolue to winne the honour and reputation of their miniſtery, for the worke of it, not from the reward of it: they muſt get their credit by preaching, not by their great liuings.</p>
                  <p>And from hence alſo is impliedly to bee collected the iuſt reproofe of many Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as preach not: ſome would preach and cannot:<note place="margin">The reproofe of Miniſters.</note> ſome can preach but will not: ſome neither can nor will, all ſhall be iudged accordingly in the day of Chriſt, when he ſhall call for an account of their Stewardſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as preach, but not Chriſt; and theſe are not all of a ſort: for 1. ſome preach themſelues, not Chriſt: or if they paint out Chriſt, it is in their owne likenes; ſo as vnder his name they commend themſelues to the world 2. ſome preach, but it is beſide Chriſt: in raking together mens inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſurely, that ſo great affecting of human authorities in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it is with a kinde of neglect of the ſearch of Scriptures, as if
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4894:126"/> they wanted wit or power, cannot be iuſtified. 3. Some preach, but it is againſt Chriſt: and ſuch are they that care not couertly to contradict the maine Doctrines of Chriſt, or elſe bend themſelues in their whole miniſtery to <hi>ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, and make ſad the hearts of the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuch as preach Chriſt; but it is for enuie: and to increaſe the bonds &amp; diſgraces of others; or it is not diligently, or they preach not Chriſt crucified (they teach not ſoundly the doctrine of mortification) or they preach not Chriſt riſen againe: they teach ſo coldly, ſo barrainely, ſo inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, as if Chriſt were ſtill in the graue: ſome there bee that preach of Chriſt, but it is chiefly of his Crowne and Scepter: they are neuer kindled, till they get into queſtions of Church-gouernment: they teach their hearers the doctrine of reforming of Churches, when they had more neede to teach them how to reforme themſelues, and their houſholds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admoniſhing and teaching.]</hi> There is ſome a-doe among Interpreters, to put the difference betweene theſe two words. Some thus: Admoniſhing them that are out of the way: teaching them that are in the way. Some thus: Admoniſhing them that are ignorant: teaching them that haue knowledge. Some thus: Admoniſhing thoſe that teach falſe doctrine, or contradict the truth: teaching ſuch as are deſirous to learne the truth. Some thus: Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing about things to be done: teaching about things to be knowne. Some thus: Admoniſhing to ſtirre affection: teaching to informe the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But I thinke there is no neceſſitie thus to reſtraine the ſenſes, ſo as it may be thus. Admoniſhing, that is, checking, rebuking, warning the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, wandring, wayward, ſloathfull, dull, or prophane hearers both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things to be done and knowne: and teaching the reſt the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admoniſhing.]</hi> From this word, theſe things may be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Preachers muſt intend to rebuke ſinne, as well as to direct or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, men commonly neuer care for inſtruction, to grow in Chriſt, till they be touched with the rebukes of the word for ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, preaching may be ſaid to admoniſh in diuers reſpects. 1. the very ſending of the Word preached to any place, is a warning to men to looke to themſelues, and repent<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Euery man.]</hi> Euery one needs to be rebuked and admoniſhed: and there is no man nor woman but they are bound to ſtoope to the rebukes of the Word; whether they be rich or poore, learned or vnlearned, Iew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, young or old, in authoritie, or vnder authoritie, conuerted or vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.</p>

                        <hi>Theſ:</hi> 1.12.</note>. Now there are diuers reaſons to perſwade men to be willing to ſuffer admonition: 1. It is noted to be in Gods account a beaſtly qualitie to rage, or to be ſenſeleſſe, when we are rebuked: therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>be not as the Horſe or Mule</hi>

Thou maiſt by ſtubborneſſe prouoke the Lord ſo much, that in his very iudgement hee may ſet a continuall edge vpon the word, to rebuke thy conſcience, ſo as <hi>rebukes</hi> being now turned into a puniſhment, the Lord may conſume thee by them, eating vpon thy conſcience <hi>as a moth</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euery man.]</hi> This is againe added, and not without reaſon: for it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: Firſt, that euery man is bound to liue vnder ſome teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing Miniſterie. Secondly, that the people, yea, all Gods people, muſt be inſtructed; contrarie to the doctrine of the Papiſts. Thirdly, a right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of this, that the word will admoniſh and teach euery man, would make men more quiet vnder rebukes, and more willing to be taught. Hee ſaith not, <hi>you,</hi> but <hi>euery man;</hi> to import that the word hath not a particular quarrell at ſome one man, but will finde out the ſinnes of all men, &amp;c. We ſee by experience that this is the ſore in many mindes, that either the Preacher ſhould meddle with no body, or not with ſuch as they: hee muſt not meddle with great men, or not with Schollers and learned men, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In all wiſedome.]</hi> Theſe words may be vnderſtood either of the ſubiect mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught, or of the inſtruments, the Teachers; or of the effect in the hearers.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: the word of God is well called wiſedome,<note place="margin">Why the word is called wiſedome.</note> eyther as it is the patterne, or Image, or reſemblance of Gods euerlaſting wiſedome, which from all eternity in his counſell hee had conceiued: or as it portrayeth out Chriſt, who is the naturall wiſedome of God: or as it vnfoldeth the depths of Gods wiſe prouidence, eſpecially in his Church: or comparatiuely with all the formes of Doctrine, conceiued by the wiſeſt of the Gentiles, or any carnall men.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond: theſe words may be referred to the Teachers,<note place="margin">What it is to teach in all wiſedome.</note> and then the ſenſe is, they muſt teach in all wiſedome. They are called <hi>wiſe men</hi>

                        <hi>Math:</hi> 23.</note>, and that they may teach <hi>in all wiſedome:</hi> firſt, they muſt be ſure they teach truth, and not errours: neither errors of Doctrine, nor errours of fact. It is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſhame for Preachers out of the Pulpit, of purpoſe to diſgrace ſome kinde of men, to report of them things vtterly vntrue: eſpecially to faile often or vſually this way. Secondly, they muſt labour to expreſſe the power of the ſpirit, as well as a ſound forme of Doctrine. Thirdly, they muſt make vſe of all opportunities and aduantages, to worke vpon the people, when a doore is opened. To preach wiſely, is to preach ſeaſonably. Fourthly, they cannot preach in the wiſedome of God, if they hunt after and effect that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4894:127"/> which the Apoſtle cals the wiſedome of words<note n="ſ" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.17.</note>: or excellency of words<note n="t" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.1.</note>.

                  <p>Thirdly, it may be ſaid to be in all wiſedome, by effect in the hearers; as being ſuch a preaching as tends to worke true wiſedome in the hearers, as well as other graces: a wiſedome I ſay, by which they <hi>vnderſtand their owne way</hi>

And contrariwiſe all true perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in CHRIST which ſhould ſo much the more comfort fearefull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſeeing their perſeuerance and the perfecting of grace begunne, is in him, it is his office to ſee it performed, and it will bee accompliſhed by his power, as it is giuen for his merits: and it ſhould teach all the faithfull to make much of communion with Chirſt, to keepe their hold, and not let goe their confidence: to preſerue by all meanes tenderneſſe, in an holy intercourſe with Chriſt; for if once Chriſt abſent himſelfe, the worke of grace will ſtand ſtill. Thirdly, this ſhewes how perfection can bee attributed to Chriſtians; namely, as in Chriſt Ieſus the euill of their workes is couered by him, and what is good is preſented by him to the Father. Laſtly, it ſhould teach vs in all our wants to ſeeke to Chriſt, in the vſe of all meanes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, to giue or confirme grace, waiting vpon him with Faith and Prayer.</p>

It is ſure that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Miniſters labours ſhould be the perfection of their hearers. It is not enough to know how to preach Sermons, but it muſt tend nor onely to beget men vnto Chriſt but alſo to build them vp, which is a wonderfull hard worke, and few Miniſters are well skilled herein; and therefore Miniſters ſhould much conſult with God, and the people ſhould pray conſtantly, and earneſtly for their Teachers.</p>

Grace will not hold out without meanes, and Knowledge muſt be encreaſed; and a daily Miniſtery is of ſingular vſe to prepare vs for death, and weyne vs from the world. Theſe and many other be the reaſons of daily preaching, which ſhould greatly reproue ſuch Miniſters as labour not, either for want of gifts, or pluralitie of places, or diſtraction of buſineſſe, or for very idleneſſe, or vnwillingneſſe to take paines.

                     <hi>According to his working that worketh in mee mightily.]</hi> Before I conſider particularly of theſe words, I note how feelingly the Apoſtle ſpeakes of Gods Prouidence, and with what affection hee ſets out the obſeruation hee made of it: which greatly ſhames the moſt of vs, that are ſo exceſſiuely dull in apprehending, and ſo affectionleſſe in the thought of things. Now if any would know what ſhould be the reaſon wee are ſo dull, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſo tenderly ſenſible of Gods power and prouidence: I may anſwere, that a number of vs are not throughly perſwaded of Gods particular proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: beſides, hee was excellently acquainted with the word of God, and thereby, hee ſaw liuely, how euery promiſe or threatning came into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there could hardly any thing fall out, but hee remembred ſome
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4894:128"/> Scripture that fore-told or fore-ſhewed it. And no queſtion hee knew how vnable the meanes was to worke without Gods bleſſing. Further, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ſuch holy men as hee, ſought Gods bleſſing by prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now they were affected, when they obſerued what followed their prayers. And beſides, the Apoſtle did <hi>walke with God</hi> in a great meaſure of ſanctitie and holy <hi>care in all things to keepe his communion with God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wee are eſtranged by our corruptions, and for the moſt part negligent in a daily walking with GOD. Laſtly, hee was humble, and not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his owne gifts, and had conſecrated himſelfe, and deuoted his life to Gods glory, and therefore hee was ſenſible of the glory of God in his working prouidence.</p>
                  <p>But the maine particular Doctrine is,<note place="margin">It is God that workes in the miniſtery of the Word.</note> that in the Miniſtery of the Goſpell there is Gods ſpeciall working: for it is Gods worke to raiſe vp men that will labour in the Goſpell, conſidering the ill ſucceſſe in many hearers, and the infirmities in themſelues, and the ſtrange diſcouragements from the world: and when the Lord hath gotten him Labourers, it is his working, that they can get fit Meditations and Affections into their hearts in priuate, and fit vtterance in publike: it is not Art and learning alone that will furniſh them with powerfull matter. And thirdly, it is Gods working to extend the power of the word to the hearers, ſo as the heate of it goe not out before it kindle in the peoples hearts. What ſhall I ſay? it is Gods mighty working that the people are preſerued and daily built vp by the word in Grace. All which ſhould teach vs to place our Faith, not in men but in the power of God. And let wicked men bee aduiſed leaſt by reſiſting the Miniſtery they bee found fighters againſt God: and it may bee a great comfort to a Miniſter to; for if God worke for vs and by vs, it matters not who be againſt vs. And laſtly, Chriſtians ſhould make much of, and bee thankefull for, and greatly admire all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Grace gotten from the word, for it was wrought by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry finger of God.</p>

               <head>THE ANALYSIS of the ſecond Chapter.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things are contained in this Chapter. Firſt, the continuation of the exhortation begun in the 23. verſe of the firſt Chapter, to v. 7. Secondly, a dehortation, from verſe 8. to the end.</p>
               <p>The exhortation is continued two waies: Firſt, By alleaging more reaſons, v. 1. 2. 3. Secondly, by prolepſis, remouing ſundry obiections, v. 4. 5. 6. 7. There are three reaſons to preſſe them to care of perſeuerance in the doctrine they had receiued: The firſt reaſon is taken from the care of the Apoſtle, for the deliuerie and defence of the Goſpell, in theſe words, <hi>I would you knew what great fighting I haue for your ſakes and for them of Laodicea and for as many as haue not ſeene my face in the fleſh,</hi> verſ. 1.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from the effects of the Goſpell, and they are two: 1. conſolation, <hi>that your hearts might be comforted:</hi> 2. loue, <hi>and knit together in loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is taken from the adiuncts of the Goſpell, and they are three: Firſt certaintie, <hi>vnto all riches of full aſſurance of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> 2. Sublimitie, <hi>to the ackowledgment of the myſterie of God euen the Father and of Chriſt,</hi> v. 2. Thirdly, perfection in theſe words, <hi>in whom,</hi> or, <hi>in which are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> v. 3.</p>
               <p>Thus of the reaſons; The anſwer of obiections followes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. Why doth the Apoſtle vrge vs ſo largely with this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Sol. <hi>This I ſay leſt any beguile you with inticing words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. But how doth he know our eſtates being abſent. <hi>Sol.</hi> To this he anſwereth, that though he were <hi>abſent in the fleſh, yet he was preſent in ſpirit,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. But it is charitie to entertaine ſurmiſes of vs, <hi>Sol.</hi> He ſaith he did <hi>reioyce</hi> in there <hi>order and ſtedfaſtnes</hi> preſent; But he wrote this to warne them to take heed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Tell vs at once what you would haue vs doe. <hi>Anſw.</hi> v. 6. 7. two things are to be done: the firſt concernes holy life, the ſecond faith. Concerning holy life, there is firſt a precept, <hi>walke on.</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a rule after which that precept is to be ſquared, viz <hi>as yee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Concerning faith, there is firſt a precept,
<pb facs="tcp:4894:130"/> they muſt be <hi>rooted built vp, and ſtabliſhed.</hi> ſecondly, a rule, <hi>as they had been taught.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus of the exhortation: The dehortation followes, from v. 8. to the end. There are three parts of the dehortation. Firſt, hee ſetteth downe the matter from which he dehorts, v. 8. Secondly, he giues ſix reaſons to confirme the dehortation, from verſe. 9. to 16. Thirdly, he concludes and that ſeuerally from v. 16. to the end.</p>
               <p>In the 8. verſe he ſets downe three thinges from which he dehorts. 1. From <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> which he calls <hi>vaine deceits.</hi> 2. From <hi>traditions of men.</hi> 3. From the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he calls the <hi>rudiments of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons are, 1. becauſe they are not after Chriſt, v. 8. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Chriſt there dwels all the fulnes of the God-head bodily, v. 9. where note an excellent deſcription of Chriſt; <hi>In him,</hi> he notes his perſon; <hi>the Godhead,</hi> his diuine nature; <hi>corporally,</hi> his humane nature, and <hi>dwells,</hi> the vnion of both; and for the meaſure, it <hi>is in all fullnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe we are compleat in Chriſt, without any of theſe thinges, v. 10. Here note the perſons, <hi>yee,</hi> the time, <hi>are,</hi> the benifit, <hi>compleat,</hi> the author, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the limitation, <hi>in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe we are circumciſed without hands, and therefore need not circumciſion made with handes, and conſequently no ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. This reaſon is propounded, v. 11. &amp; confirmed by prolepſis, v. 12.</p>
               <p>Concerning Circumciſion without hands, fiue thinges are to be noted. 1. the perſons, <hi>yee.</hi> 2. the time, <hi>are.</hi> 3. the manner, ſet downe negatiuely, <hi>without hands.</hi> 4. the form of it, affirmitiuely, <hi>putting off the bodie of the ſins of the fleſh.</hi> 5. the efficient cauſe, <hi>the circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But it followes not we are circumciſed without hands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not circumciſion with hands. <hi>Sol.</hi> It followes to vs now in the new Teſtament, becauſe we haue baptiſme in ſteed of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with hands: we are <hi>buried with Chriſt by baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But was not Circumſion a more liuely ſigne. <hi>Sol.</hi> It was not, which he ſhewes to be true, both in reſpect of mortification, <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him,</hi> and in reſpect of viuification, <hi>raiſed vp together with him by baptiſme,</hi> which is amplified by ſetting downe what is required in them to whom baptiſme is thus effectuall, viz. <hi>the faith of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe none of theſe can helpe vs in miſerie, nor further to happineſſe, when we want it, v. 13. The words in themſelues expres a two fold eſtate of Chriſtians, Firſt, what they are by nature, and ſo 1. they were <hi>dead</hi> in actuall <hi>ſinnes.</hi> 2. they were in the <hi>vncircumciſion of the fleſh,</hi> in reſpect of originall ſinne. Secondly, what they were in the ſtate of grace, 1. they <hi>were quickned.</hi> 2. they were <hi>forgiuen all their ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe Chriſt hath cancelled the <hi>Chyrographie</hi> that was againſt vs, which were theſe ceremonies, v. 14. 15. concerning theſe, two things may be noted. 1. what the ceremonies were in themſelues. 2. how the Church was diſcharged of them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4894:130"/>
               <p>For the firſt they were for honor, <hi>ordinances of God,</hi> for vſe, <hi>hand-writings,</hi> for effect, <hi>they were againſt vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſecond, Chriſt <hi>on the croſſe cancelled them, faſtned them,</hi> and <hi>tooke them out of the way:</hi> yea, he ſpoyled the Diuels, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer them openly, who had the power to ſerue execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for forfeitures, v. 15.</p>
               <p>Thus of the reaſons: the concluſion followes from v. 16, to the end. The concluſion hath three branches. For firſt hee concludes againſt ceremonies, v. 16. 17. Secondly againſt philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, v. 18. 19. Thirdly, againſt traditions, v. 20. to the end.</p>
               <p>In the concluſion againſt ceremonies, note 1. the thinges which are named to be abrogated, viz. the reſpect <hi>of meats and drinks.</hi> 2. of times, which are threefold, 1. <hi>daies.</hi> 2. <hi>moneths.</hi> 3. <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> theſe are the things, v. 16. The reaſon is v. 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are <hi>but ſhadowes of things to come, and the body is Chriſt.</hi>

Beware leſt there bee any man that ſpoyle you through Philoſophy and vaine deceit, through the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, and not after Chriſt.</note> I would haue you by all meanes to ſeeke to to be further rooted and built vp and ſtabliſhed in the aſſurance of faith accordingly as you haue beene taught, but by any meanes remember to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in all thankfulneſſe to <hi>GOD,</hi> for the happie eſtate you are in: And thus for what I haue to exhort you to in matters of doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt enter vpon matter of dehortation, take heede, leſt anie man of what gifts or profeſsion ſoeuer, make a prey of your ſoules, and carrie them away as a ſpoile: And in particular looke to it in three things, firſt in Philoſophie, not ſimply in the doctrines of Philoſophie, but in ſuch deuiſes, and vaine fancies, as vnder colour of ſuch ſpeculation, or from the authoritie of Philoſophers are brought in by any. Secondly, take heede of traditions of men. And thirdly, of the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were things at firſt brought in to bee as the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> or alphabet to traine vp the people of <hi>GOD</hi> in the principles: But now this and the other are not to bee regarded for many reaſons, wherof the firſt is, they are not after <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides there is ſuch an infinite fulneſſe in <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. For in him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the godhead bodily. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. And ye are compleat in him who is the head of all principality and power.</note> by reaſon of the diuine nature that dwels by an vnexpreſsible vnion in the humane nature, that we need not ſeeke to any thing elſe but only vnto <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you your ſelues in <hi>CHRIST</hi> haue all compleatneſſe, and fuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency by reaſon of your myſticall vnion with him, and ſuch is the fulnes of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that the verie Angels thoſe excellent &amp; potent creatures, are ſubordinate to him, and acknowledge him as their head, which by the waie ſhewes that they are not to be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake yet more expreſly what ſhould you do with circumciſion or any part of the law ceremoniall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. In whom alſo ye are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh by the circumciſion of CHRIST. <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. In that yee are buried with him through baptiſme, in whom yee are alſo rayſed vp together through the faith of the operation of GOD, which raiſed him from the dead. <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. And you being dead in your ſinnes, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion of the fleſh hath hee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with him, forgiuing you all your treſpaſſes. <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt vs, which was contrary to vs, and tooke it out of the way, nayling it to his croſſe.</note> ſeeing in <hi>CHRIST</hi> yee haue receiued that which was ſignified by circumciſion; for in him you are circumciſed not with the hands of men, as they were vnder the law, but by the finger of the ſpirit of <hi>GOD:</hi> which ſtands in the mortification of that bodie of ſinnes, which yee were guiltie of while yee were in the fleſh, and this ye haue by the vertue of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> circumciſion.</p>
               <p>And if you ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> had the circumciſion without hands, and yet was circumciſed in the fleſh, I anſwer, that we haue baptiſme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that circumciſion, and therefore need it not: and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe baptiſme doth ſo liuely ſet out our ſpirituall buriall and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>CHRIST,</hi> which all they attaine vnto that haue the faith of <hi>GODS</hi> operation, that is, that can beleeue that which <hi>GOD</hi> by his power will do what he promiſeth in baptiſme, grounding their faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſurrection of <hi>CHRIST</hi> from the dead.</p>
               <p>And further this ſhould moue you to diſregard thoſe things, becauſe they neither could help you when you were miſerable, nor conferre the benefits vpon you which you enioy without them, for in your eſtate of nature you were dead in actuall ſinnes, and in reſpect of originall ſinne you liued in the vncircumciſion of the fleſh: and ſince you were quickned by true regeneration you haue obtained the forgiueneſſe of all your ſins, and therefore what would you haue more from theſe things.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the ceremonies though they were ordinances of <hi>GOD</hi> at the firſt, yet they were hand-writings againſt vs, and now <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath
<pb facs="tcp:4894:132"/> cancelled them, and faſtned the obligation vpon the croſſe, and ſo taken them out of the way. and therefore you ſhould neuer more haue minde to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

Let no man therefore condemne you in meat and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the ſabbath daies. <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. Which are but a ſhadow of things to come: but the body is in Chriſt <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. Let no man at his pleaſure beare rule ouer you by humblenes of mind, and worſhipping of Angels, aduancing himſelfe in <hi>&amp;c. Verſe</hi> 19. And hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the head, wherof all the body is furniſhed and knit together by ioynts and bands, <hi>&amp;c. Verſe</hi> 20. Wherefore if yee bee dead with Chriſt from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the world, <hi>&amp;c. Verſe</hi> 21. As, touch not, taſte not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not. <hi>Verſe</hi> 22. Which all periſh with the vſing and are after the commandements &amp; doctrines of men. <hi>Verſe</hi> 23. Which things haue indeede a ſhew of wiſdome, in voluntary religion and humbleneſſe of minde, and in not ſparing the bodie, neither haue they it in any eſtimation to ſatisfie the fleſh.</note>And the rather becauſe our Sauiour hath not only cancelled them, but he hath ſpoyled the Diuels which had power to execute the forfeitures of theſe bonds, I ſay both in himſelfe on the croſſe, and in vs daily he hath and doth ſpoyle them, and triumph ouer them, and make an open ſhew of them, ſo as we are freed from the danger of their arreſts.</p>
               <p>Now therfore I come to the concluſion which I direct diſtinctly, firſt, againſt the ceremonies, then againſt philoſophy, and laſtly againſt tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Firſt, I ſay, let no man condemne you, (or if they doe care not for it) condemne you I ſay for any of the ceremonies, whether it be about meates or drinkes, or about the ceremoniall dayes, or moneths, or ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, that were required in that law.</p>
               <p>For theſe and all the reſt were but ſhadowes of things to come, and now in <hi>CHRIST</hi> we haue the ſubſtance and body of them.</p>
               <p>The like I ſay againſt philoſophie and in ſpeciall againſt Angell wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, let no man beare rule ouer your conſciences, for they that bring in this doctrine, do it hypocritically vpon pretence that it tends to make men humble, and they do it very ignorantly, for they neuer ſaw the kingdome of Angels, nor what is done in heauen, and moſt proudly doe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance themſelues, ſwelling in the vaine conceits of their fleſhly mindes.</p>
               <p>Yea, they that bring in this doctrine fall from the foundation, &amp; hold not <hi>CHRIST,</hi> who is the head of the Church, of whom euery member doth depend, and the whole body is excellently furniſhed, and indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knit together, and encreaſe with the encreaſing of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly for traditions, I wonder at it you ſhould be clogged with them, ſeeing you are deliuered from them in the death of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and they are not ſo honourable as the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but are vile burthens.</p>
               <p>Thinke but with your ſelues, how vainly they impoſe vpon you, when they ſay, touch not, taſte not, handle not.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe are periſhable things, and fit nothing at all to eternall life, and further they are euidently the common documents and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, and doctrines of men, that neuer had warrant in the word of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, they find out many faire pretences to blind mens eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as that heereby wee ſhew ſpeciall Zeale to <hi>GOD</hi> in doing more then hee commandeth, and theſe things ſeeme to tend to humilitie and the taming of the fleſh, but all theſe are but ſhewes, and therefore naught whatſoeuer they ſay, becauſe they yeelde not a due reſpect euen to the body of man.</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in the three firſt verſes, and the anſwer to the obiections in the foure next.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon is taken from the care the Apoſtle tooke for them in the worke of his miniſterie, in this verſe. The ſecond reaſon is from the effects of the Goſpell, viz. conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loue, verſ. 2. The third reaſon is from certaine adiuncts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, viz. certaintie, ſublimitie, and perfection, verſ. 3.2.</p>

                  <p>Thus wee ſee the order and generall meaning and dependance of all theſe firſt 7. verſes.</p>
                  <p>In this firſt verſe the Apoſtle would ſtirre vp the Coloſſians to conſtancy in the Goſpell receiued, by ſhewing his great care and daily ſtrife for them and their good.</p>
                  <p>It is not vnlawfull in ſome caſes to praiſe a mans ſelfe: the Apoſtle heere doth it: nor is it vnlawfull to vſe rhetoricall inſinuations, to winne and excite affection in the people. <hi>Paul</hi> would perſwade by ſhewing his owne care for them. But ſure it is, Miniſters ſhall hardly euer profit the people, or power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4894:134"/> perſwade with them vnto conſtancie in receiuing and retaining the care of their doctrine, vnleſſe they ſhew their owne care in teaching, and their owne loue to the people they would perſwade.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What a greate conflict.] Paul</hi> ſhewes his great loue to them: hee fighteth for them, and this he did when in all likelihood he ſhould imploy his cares for himſelfe, being now in ſuch ſtraits, as it were in the middeſt of death, and the rather they ſhould be affected with this proofe of his loue in them, becauſe they were abſent from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For.]</hi> This <hi>for</hi> ſhewes an <hi>aitiologie;</hi> for it points to a dependance vpon the laſt verſe of the former chapter: there he had ſhewed what paine hee tooke, and how mightily the Lord had ſhewed his power in working through his miniſterie. Now he tels of a fight and combat, which euidently imports, that when the Goſpell workes vpon mens conſciences, and the miniſterie of Gods ſeruants proues effectuall and powerfull, there will follow ſome ſtirre and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there will be a conflict and ſtrife.</p>
                  <p>Yet hence alſo may begathered, that the grace of the Goſpell is excellent, and worthy the hauing, elſe there would not be ſo much adoe to hinder it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What great conflict or fighting.]</hi>

But leauing the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the matter is plaine, that if Miniſters execute their offices ſincerely, they muſt looke for a battle and opoſition.

                  <p>If any aske how this fight ſhould grow: I anſwer: Firſt, it is manifeſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is the enemie of all goodneſſe, and will croſſe the Goſpell what he can: Beſides, the fleſh both in Miniſters and people will luſt and ſtriue againſt the ſpirit; a Miniſter ſhould haue ſomething to doe to <hi>beate downe his owne fleſh</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</note>. And in the Apoſtles times Tyrants with their ciuill or rather vnciuill ſword did fight againſt the truth: ſo did heretickes with the tares and poiſon of their infectious doctrine: ſo did the Infidels alſo with ſlanders and outrages. And though theſe ceaſe, yet oppoſition will riſe from other ſorts of men: for in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall all men of wicked life will <hi>be contrarie to ſound doctrine</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</note>; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly both worldlings and epicures doe in all places diſcouer their diſlike of the faithfull and diligent preaching of the Goſpell, in as much as the word would reſtraine the exceſſe of their pleaſures and <hi>cares of life;</hi> yea the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honeſt men of the world, though they giue heauen good words, and can be long more quiet then the former, yet let once their inward corruption bee ranſacked, or their ſpeciall euils powerfully vnmasked, they will become like horſes and mules, they wil ſtrike at all that croſſeth the praiſe of their quiet eſtate. And for temporizers, it is wonderfull euident, that in all places they hold it a point of their care, to ſe that ſound preaching be diſgraced. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer by Gods ſingular mercie amongſt vs in this Nation, by the lawes of the Kingdome, preaching is both eſtabliſhed and protected with honour, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in practiſe people of all degrees tend to libertie, and many greate ones like not that preaching that ſhould diſcouer or reſtraine the greeuous exceſſes of the time: hence it is that ſuch as ſerue the humours of men, and run in the current or prophaneneſſe, doe euery where take all aduantages to diſgrace painfull and godly Preachers and preaching. Beſides, ſuch is the helliſh ſpight and rage of Papiſts and popiſh perſons in all places, that in imitation of their

                  <p>There is a communion with the abſent members of Chriſt, euen with ſuch as we neuer ſaw in the face, a communion I ſay in the ſame head, and in the ſame ſpirit, and in the ſame priuiledges, of a regenerated life. And we ſee here we are bound to deſire and indeuour the good of the abſent Saints as well as

                     <hi>For them of Laodicea.]</hi> Though there were many Cities of this name, yet I thinke this is the Laodicea mentioned Reuel. 3. If the eſtate of theſe Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans be well marked as it is there deſcribed, we may obſerue, That in matters of religion and Gods worſhip, they were neither <hi>hot nor colde,</hi> That they thought they had as good hearts to God as any, that they were in loue with no ſauing grace, that they were vtterly ignorant of the doctrine of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, that they would take no paines either about iuſtification or ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. yet no doubt God had his remnant among theſe, Chriſt was <hi>Amen</hi> in this Church, he did faithfully performe his promiſes, and they were ſuch as by a <hi>new creation</hi> of God were begotten againe, euen amongſt ſo careleſſe a multitude.

                  <p>IN the beginning of this verſe is contained the ſecond reaſon, taken from the effects of the Goſpell, which are two: the firſt, conſolation; the ſecond, eſtabliſhment of their hearts in brotherly loue; the reſt of the words of this verſe belongs to the third reaſon, as ſhall appeare afterward.</p>
                  <p>This is the fruit of the care and earneſt ſtrife of godly Teachers in their painefull labours of the Goſpell, that it breeds much comfort in the hearts of Gods people, and likewiſe greatly confirmes them, and ſettles them in the mutall loue one of another: it <hi>knits their hearts together.</hi> And contrariwiſe we may generally here note the hurt and miſcheefe that falſe and corrupt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers bring vpon men. They hinder the conſultations of Gods people, in that they draw them away from God the fountaine of all conſolation: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they withdraw them from the ſocietie and fellowſhip with the Saints. But this is but generall. I conſider diſtinctly of each of theſe effects.</p>

Alas, alas, this is the eſtate of euery wicked mans if he had eyes to ſee what belongs vnto him, and what is his danger, as theſe places ſhew, whence theſe compariſons are taken, Iob 18.18.7.8. &amp; 20.24.15. &amp; 15.20.21.26.30. certainely heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away before one iote of theſe miſeries ſhall be remoued out of the way ſo as they ſhould not fall vpon wicked men being impenitent: and alas what then can outward things doe vnto them?

                  <p>How the Goſpell is a myſterie, and to whom, hath been ſhewed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter: onely let vs from the repetition of it here, be confirmed in this, neuer to truſt the iudgement of carnall perſons, in matters of godlineſſe and ſaluation, for they pronounce of things they neuer effectually vnderſtand, they cannot perceiue the things of God; and withall we ſhould be excited to a daily care of faith, for reaſon will not reach heere.</p>
                  <p>Further we may here obſerue, That when the Lord doth reueale this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie vnto vs, we muſt not only beleeue it, but we muſt acknowledge it, euen by an outward profeſſion of our faith in Chriſt, and our conſecration of our ſelues, to the worſhip and knowledge of God. The world wonderfull hardly brooks acknowledgement: moſt men aske what needs this profeſſion? they will not vnderſtand that we muſt beare about, and hold out the light of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4894:139"/> truth receiued, labouring to winne glorie to God by the power of confeſſion and obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of God euen the Father and of Chriſt.]</hi> Diuers things may bee from theſe words particularly obſerued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may ſee here the glorie of the Goſpell, and the ſtudies of Chriſtians, they haue the onely excellent ſubiect in the world: other ſciences conſider of the creature, but Theologie of the Creator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Heere is a plaine proofe of the diuine nature of Chriſt, for God is ſayd to be the Father of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From coherence wee may know, that as men grow in faith and loue, ſo they will be more and more ſettled in the doctrine of the perſons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, tis ſuch a myſterie as is reuealed by degrees, as holineſſe and other ſauing knowledges increaſe in vs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That wee neuer rightly know God till we know Chriſt, Matth. 11.27. 1 Ioh. 2.23.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Wee may hence obſerue the miſerie of all vnregenerate men, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know God nor Chriſt aright.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That howſoeuer we be ignorant in many other knowledges and that of matters of religion too, yet it is a glorious riches to know God to be our father in Chriſt, and to be fully aſſured of Gods loue in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Note heere with what feeling the Apoſtle ſpeakes, when he fals vpon the mention of Chriſt, and the Goſpell: hee abounds in powerfull affections and admirations of theſe things, which may wonderfully abaſe and humble vs, for our barrennes both in thoughts, and affections, and words, when we haue to deale with the things that belong to the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if there bee any ſuch treaſures in Chriſt and the Goſpell, wee may conclude it is not in vaine to deuote our ſelues to the knowledge of Chriſt in the Goſpell, though it coſt vs neuer ſo much pains, or care, or coſt, and though we be neuer ſo much oppoſed by the fleſh and the world.</p>
                  <p>Further, wee neede not doubt but that all things needfull to ſaluation and happineſſe, are contained in the word, heere are treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, wee neede no traditions nor inuentions of men, nor decrees of Popes &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Thus in generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In whom]</hi> Wiſdome and knowledge are in Chriſt, in Angels, in Men, but

There are diuers gifts conferred vpon the humane nature of Chriſt, the gift of perſonall vnion, the gift of office of mediator, and head of the Church, the gift of adoration, with his diuine nature, and the gifts they call habituall, which aboue the meaſure of men or angels are conferred vpon him.</p>
                  <p>Which may comfort vs againſt all our defects in our ſelues, for though we haue ſo many wants, yet wee haue an head in whom wee haue all fulneſſe, and it ſhould bee our courſe to make vſe of this doctrine, by ſtirring vp our ſelues daily to lay holde vpon Chriſt for the ſupply of our wants out of the riches of his grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Are hidden]</hi> The admirable excellencies of wiſdome and knowledge in Chriſt are ſayd to be hidden, 1. In reſpect of our apprehenſions, becauſe we can neuer reach to the depth of them, 2. In reſpect of the croſſe, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt and his members: for the croſſe like a vaile obſcured the glorie of Chriſts perfections, both in himſelfe, and the communication of his gifts to his members.</p>
                  <p>And may not this teach vs ſinglenes of heart, and humility, euen more to ſeeke to bee good then to ſeeme to be ſo? Chriſt was contented his treaſures ſhould bee hidden, and ſhall wee fret ourſelues when our drops of grace are not admired? ſhall it not be enough to vs that we ſhall appeare in glory, when his glorie ſhall be reuealed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All treaſures]</hi> Wiſdome and knowledge in Chriſt is called treaſures, not for the quantitie only, but for the worth alſo, for grace and knowledge are the beſt treaſures.</p>
                  <p>Which may ſhew the miſerie of all wicked perſons, for in as much as they are not of Chriſt, they are deſtitute of the treaſures of God: and contrariwiſe, they are moſt happy that haue Chriſt, for in him they find all true treaſure &amp; riches, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be poore that hath Chriſt, nor can he be rich that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Chriſt</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of knowledge and wiſdome.]</hi> The different termes may note but the ſame knowledge in Chriſt, but for our capacities varied: It is true that there is in Chriſt a moſt admirable perfection, both of the knowledge of contemplation, and of the wiſdome and diſcretion of working and practiſe, and thus it was in him, in his owne obedience, and is ſtill by participation to his members to make them wiſe and diſcreet, as well as full of vnderſtanding and iudgement: ſure it is that Chriſt would be rich vnto vs, in the gift of holy diſcretion, aſwell as in the gift of holy vnderſtanding, if wee would ſeeke it of him, for hee is <hi>made vnto vs of God wiſdome</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note>, neither can true wiſdome bee found in any men vnder the ſunne, that haue not the true grace of Chriſt, neither can any Chriſtian be found without the grounds of heauenly wiſdome, ſuch wiſdome I meane as none of the wiſeſt men in the world could euer attaine, for though it bee true, that there may bee and are many deficiencies in ſuch as otherwiſe truely feare God, yet if the beſt wiſdome be enquired after, the meaneſt and ſimpleſt Chriſtian doth exceed the greateſt and exacteſt politician, or <hi>diſputer of this world.</hi> For what wiſdome can it be for a man to haue excelling skill to know the ſecrets of nature, or the order of ciuill affaires, or the wayes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his own outward eſtate, and yet know no certaine and ſafe way how to ſaue his owne ſoule?</p>

                  <p>WHereas the Coloſſians might aske, why the Apoſtle is ſo large in vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to conſtancie, he ſhewes in this verſe, that it is to preuent the inticements of ſeducers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the dutie of euery Miniſter to labour by all poſſible meanes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his people, that they be not beguiled: tis not enough to teach them true doctrine, but they muſt be watchfull, that neither Sathan nor euill men infect and corrupt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the vſuall practiſe of the deuill, when the word hath wrought with any power in any place, to aſſay by all meanes, to draw away and deceiue the mindes of the people: let men looke to themſelues, and not liue ſecurely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for certainly the deuill will attempt them with all cunning and fraud.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If theſe words be compared with the Apoſtles exhortation in the 23. verſe, of the former chapter, it will appeare manifeſtly, that one reaſon why many are deceiued, is there vnſetlednes, in the doctrine of faith and hope: if they had been eſtabliſhed in their aſſurance of Gods fauour in Chriſt, and the hope brought by the Goſpell, they could not haue been ſo deceiued, and beguiled, or not ſo eaſily.</p>

The deuill were wonderfull ſimple, if he ſhould thinke, to bewitch men ſo far, as to beleeue with any confidence, things that had manifeſt apparance of falſhood, that cannot be. Thus in generall.</p>
                  <p>Now in particular, concerning the corrupting or deceiuing of the ſoules of men, wee may conſider three things. 1. The miſerabel eſtate of the ſoule, that is deceiued, or beguiled, or corrupted. 2 How the ſoule is corrupted. 3. The meanes to preuent it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, looke what the carcaſe is when it is putrified, ſuch is the ſoule when it is corrupted, it is ſpiritually loath ſome, and wonderfully vnpleaſing vnto God, and caſt out of his ſight: and the more is the miſerie of ſuch ſoules, becauſe to pleade th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the ſecond, if we aske by whome or how the ſoule is deceiued or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4894:141"/> It is to be anſwered generally, wee muſt take notice of it to beware: the two greate deceiuers,<note place="margin">Who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers.</note> are the deuill and Antichriſt<note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</note>. It is true that by the malice of Sathan, and frowardneſſe of wicked men, Gods faithfull ſeruants are euerie where called deceiuers<note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note>. They that moſt labour to preſerue mens ſoules from corrupting, are moſt charged with ſeducing; but theſe are ſo called and are not.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ordinarie deceiuers, are 1. carnall friends, 2. the Profits and pleaſures of life, 3. euill companie, this corrupts like leauen, 4. carnall reaſon, 5. ſinne<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, if we would not be beguilde and deceiued, we muſt looke to three things, 1. we muſt get a ſtedfaſt faith in Ieſus Chriſt, plerophorie or full aſſurance of Gods fauour is a wonderfull preſeruatiue againſt corruption of doctrine or life. 2. we muſt conſtantly cleaue to the meanes, vnto which God hath giuen teſtemonie by the power of his preſence, and bleſſing; wee ſhould get vnder the ſhelter of a powerfull miniſterie, and this will be a rocke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. 3. we muſt preſerue vprightnes of life, and our care of innocencie in what we know to be required: contrariwiſe, ſo long as we are vnſetled, and want aſſurance, eſpecially if we liue not vnder the power of the word, we are in continuall danger to be drawne away: and ſo it is with vs too, if wee fall vnto the loue of any ſinne, of knowledge; for corruption of life is many times ſcourged with corruption of doctrine and opinions.</p>
                  <p>But if we would haue more aboundant caution for our preſeruation, then I will follow the ſimilitude of beguiling amongſt men, from whence by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, we may learne many things, for our caucion and obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Men that would thriue in their eſtates, and would not be beguiled in the world or wronged, obſerue moſt an end, theſe rules. 1. They will buy ſuch things as are durable, not toyes or trifles: ſo ſhould we, we ſhould ſet our hearts vpon eternall things, and not minde earthly things, which will laſt but for a ſhort time, and when death comes, if we truſt vpon earthly things, wee ſhall finde our ſelues deceiued. 2. They will know their commodities themſelues that they ſell or buy: ſo ſhould we both for the ſinnes wee would part with, and the opinions, or duties, we would purchaſe. 3. They will know the perſons, with whome they deale: ſo ſhould wee try the ſpirits. 4. They will haue all the ſecuritie may be had: ſo ſhould we ſee all warranted by the ſcriptures, for other ſecuritie we cannot haue put in that is ſufficient if the diuell or the world or corrupt teachers, tempt and intice vs, wee muſt put them to it, to put vs in ſecuritie from the ſcriptures, which becauſe they cannot doe, we muſt wiſely reiect them. 5. Men that deale for much, are glad to ſeeke the protection of ſome greate men: ſo ſhould we ſeeke the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the great God. 6. If men doubt in any thing about their eſtate, they will preſently conſult with their friends, and in difficult caſes they will haue opinions of Lawyers too: ſo ſhould we doe if we would haue our ſtates ſafe, wee muſt propound our doubts one to a nother, eſpecially to our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that they may reſolue vs out of the word of God.</p>

Yet in truth Magiſtrates, whether good or euill men, doe much euill by ſuffering euill to be vnpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But to returne to the point, Magiſtrates that would preſerue order, muſt giue good example themſelues, and mend the diſorders of their one houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and bring ſuch a ſympathie and loue of the people, as they ſhould both preſerue their authoritie, and yet remember that they rule their brethren. And in their gouernment they cannot obſerue order, vnleſſe they puniſh vice as well as command or prouide for vertue and wealth. Beſides, they muſt take away the perſons or places that are occaſions of diſorder, and they muſt charge and remunerate as well as puniſh. Finally, the people out of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of conſcience muſt ſtriue to liue in order, with reuerence and feare
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4894:142"/> yeelding ready obedience and furtherance to thoſe that are placed in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Order in the Church.</note>There is order alſo in the Church: and thus there is order in doctrine, for milke muſt be propounded before ſtrong meat, or with ſufficient reference to the parties to be taught. There is order alſo to be obſerued in the time, places, and manner of celebration of Gods worſhip. There is order alſo to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the vſe of things eccleſiaſtically indifferent. There is order in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of perſons, in the miniſtery, ſome to rule, ſome to teach, ſome to exhort, ſome to diſtribute. There is order alſo to be obſerued in the diſcipline of the Church, proceeding by degrees with offenders, ſo long as they are cureable.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Order in the family.</note>Neither may our families be without order; order I ſay, not only in the duties that concerne the maintenance of the familie, but alſo in the exerciſes that concerne religion and the ſeruice of God in the familie.

In the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie alſo there muſt bee a daily exerciſe of patience, humilitie, knowledge, and all other Chriſtian graces, that concerne mutuall edification. What ſhould I ſay? There is a mutuall relation in all the members of the familie one to another, and the diſcharge of their ſeuerall duties one to another is charged with a daily care of order.</p>
                  <p>But I thinke the Apoſtle commends the order of holy life vnto which euery Chriſtian is bound. It is certaine we can neuer ſoundly proceed in godlineſſe without a care of a ſettled frame and order of liuing. Wee may not liue at a venture in religion.

                  <p>There are many impediments of an orderly conuerſation:<note place="margin">Nine lets of order.</note> 1. Men are not reconciled to God, and ſo not being in Chriſt, they receiue not influence of grace from Chriſt to enable them to walke in an holy courſe. 2. In others tis negligent mortification; the ſtaine of former ſinnes being not waſhed away, there remaines in them an ill diſpoſition to ſinne. 3. Many are enſnared with euill opinions, either in doctrine, (and ſo errour of life is the ſcourge of errour in opinion) or elſe about practiſe, as that ſuch ſtrictneſſe is not required, or it is impoſſible, or none doe liue ſo. 4.

                  <p>Now if any be deſirous to know in generall what he ſhould do to bring his life into order, I ſhall profitably aduiſe fiue things: Firſt,<note place="margin">Rules for bringing our liues into order.</note> that hee doe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely withdraw himſelfe from the ſinnes of the times, and keepe himſelfe <hi>vnspotted of the world,</hi> in reſpect of them. Now the ſinnes of the times are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, pride of life, contempt of the Goſpell, coldneſſe in faith and religion, ſwearing, profanation of the holy Sabbath, domeſticall irreligiouſneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, vſury, whoredome, drunkenneſſe, and <hi>drinkings,</hi> oppreſſion and ſpeaking euill of the good way. Secondly, that hee obſerue the more vſuall corruptions of the calling of life hee liues in, and with all heedfulneſſe ſhun them, whether he be Magiſtrate, Miniſter, or priuate perſon. Thirdly, that he eſpecially ſtriue againſt and ſubdue the euils that by nature hee is moſt prone vnto. Fourthly, he ſhall doe wonderfully profitably,<note place="margin">Vſe of cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</note> if hee would get a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of duties out of the whole law, that directly concerne himſelfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is very eaſie (eſpecially by the helpe of ſome that are experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) to be diſtinctly gathered, labouring to ſhew all good faithfulneſſe in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of pietie as well as righteouſneſſe, and to ſtriue for inward pietie as well as outward, reſoluing to continue, as well as once to begin. Hence it is, if wee marke it, that the holy Ghoſt in diuers Scriptures drawes for the people of thoſe times diuers catalogues, either of grace which ſpecially tended to their praiſe, or of duties that moſt fitted their ſtate, or of ſinnes that they muſt moſt carefully auoyd, as being moſt commonly committed: yea, it could not but be of excellent vſe, if we did taske our ſelues to the more ſtrict obſeruation of ſome of thoſe catalogues, either of grace, or ſinnes, or duties, as wee might perceiue they moſt fitted vs.</p>
                  <p>But if euer we would goe about the order of our liues,<note place="margin">More rules.</note> wee muſt in generall 1. labour to weaken the loue of earthly things. 2.

                  <p>Not Scripture onely, but vſuall experience ſhew the many inconueniences that attend ſuch as are not ſtabliſhed in the faith.</p>

                  <p>Now for the remedies of this vnſetlednes;<note place="margin">Remedies for faith vveake.</note> This weake faith will grow ſetled more and more, if they continue vpright in the vſe of the meanes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as their reformation and victorie ouer ſinne increaſeth, and as they grow more and more confirmed in the diuorce from the world, and carnall companie, and they grow more <hi>expert in the word of righteouſneſſe,</hi> eſpecially after the Lord hath refreſhed them with the frequent comforts of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

                     <note place="margin">Cauſes of faith vveakned</note>There may be diuers cauſes or meanes to weaken ſtrong faith. 1. Loſſe of meanes. 2. ſecret ſinnes ordinarily committed, not lamented not reformed. 3. Preſumptiouſly to vſe ill meanes to get out of aduerſitie. 4. Relapſe to the loue of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Signes of faith vveakned.</note>The ſignes to diſcerne it, are 1. the ſleepineſſe of the heart. 2. feare of death. 3. conſtant neglect or ſecret contempt of fellowſhip with the godly. 4. The ceaſing of the ſenſible working of Gods ſpirit within. 5. Raigning diſcontentment. 6. Securitie vnder knowne ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Remedies for faith vveakned.</note>The remedies are 1. A ſerious and ſound examination of the wants and faults, which by this weaknes they are fallen into. 2. A conſtant and daily iudging of themſelues, for their corruptions, till they recouer tenderneſſe of heart, and ſome meaſure of godly ſorrow for them. 3. It will be expedient that they plant themſelues vnder the droppings of a daily powerfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. 4. The meditation of their former feelings. 5. The vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper; this is a meanes to confirme faith both weake and weakned. Laſtly, they muſt hold a moſt ſtrict watch ouer their hearts and liues, till they be re-eſtabliſhed in a ſound courſe of reformed life.</p>
                  <p>Thus of faith weakned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Stedfaſtnes may be loſt, note that I ſay ſtedfaſtnes of faith may be loſt, I ſay not that faith may be loſt that is true faith; this ſtedfaſtnes was loſt in <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and it is likely in <hi>Iob</hi> too.</p>

In ſome, it is ſome horrible ſinne, I ſay horrible ſinne, either becauſe it is ſome foule tranſgreſſion, as in <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon;</hi> or made horrible by long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in it.</p>

                  <p>The effects<note place="margin">The effects.</note> and concomitants of this relapſe, and loſſe of ſtedfaſtnes, are diuers, and fearefull, as 1. The ceaſing of the comforts of the ſpirit, the ſpirit being a ſleep, and in a manner quenched. 2. The heart is excommunicated from the power of Gods ordinances, as they may feele when they come to vſe them. 3. Spirituall boldnes or incouragement to come vnto God is loſt with it. 4. They are ſecretly deliuered to Satan to be whipped and buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with tentations many times of blaſphemie or atheiſme, or otherwiſe through his ſpirituall wickedneſſe, held in internall vaſſalage. 5. Moſt an end, the outward prouidence of God is changed towards them, yea ſome times they are ſcourged with horrible croſſes. 6. Many times they are giuen ouer to be puniſhed with other ſinnes.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:4894:144"/>
                  <p>Yet for the more full vnderſtanding heereof,<note place="margin">Diſtinctions about apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</note> it will be profitable to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome diſtinctions, both of the perſons, and the cauſe, and the effects. For of theſe that fall from their ſtedfaſtnes, ſome are ſenſible of it, ſome are inſenſible: Thoſe that haue their hearts wakened after this loſſe, doe vſually feele a ſtrong conflict of terrours, the conſcience being wearied with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that their wounded ſpirit is tormented withall, vnder the ſence of Gods fierce anger, and in many of theſe their terrour is renued vpon euery croſſe, yea almoſt at euery word of God, ſo doth the conceit of Gods fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them preuaile with them.</p>
                  <p>Now in the inſenſible, the ſpeciall effect is a ſpirituall ſlumber or lethargy, with the reſt of the ill effects before in common propounded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a diſtinction muſt bee made of the cauſe, for the ſinne is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſecret, ſometimes open: now the conſequents or fruits of open falling, by open ſinne is diuers, vſually <hi>the fall thereof is great,</hi> it makes a wonderfull noyſe in the Church, beſides it wounds the hearts of Gods children, and breeds exceeding great diſtaſte in them. Further their fals makes them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull vile before the world, the mouth of euery beaſt will bee open to raile againſt them: wicked men will keepe the aſſiſe for them, yea the bankes of blaſphemie in wicked men will bee broken downe, ſo as they will with full mouth ſpeake euill of the good way of God; beſides it cannot bee auoyded but many will bee defiled by it, and wonderfully fired and confirmed in ſinning.</p>
                  <p>Againe, wee muſt diſtinguiſh of effects or conſequents, for ſome are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, ſome extraordinarie: for ſometimes beſides the ordinarie euents, the Lord ſcourgeth thoſe fals with Satanicall moleſtations, either of their perſons or houſes, yea, ſometimes they are ſmitten with death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But doe all theſe come alwaies for ſinne?</p>

Hee hath the ſpirit of God in him, but he is locked vp and taken priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Now for the remedies of this loſſe of ſtedfaſtneſſe,<note place="margin">Remedies for the loſſe of ſtedfaſtneſſe.</note> they muſt know that there is required of them, a ſpeciall humiliation, note that I ſay a ſpeciall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: For they muſt in priuate afflict their ſoules before the view of their ſpeciall ſinnes, and Gods fierce wrath, with ſtrong cries and ſighes vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble making their moane before God, They muſt <hi>cry vnto God out of the deepe,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith. Beſides they muſt ſhame themſelues openly by making
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4894:145"/> themſelues vile before the people of God, ſo did <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> yea they muſt voluntarily reſigne ouer themſelues vnto Gods ſcourging hand, being ſo deſirous to be cleanſed of their ſins, as to bee contented God ſhould waſh them throughly though it were with many croſſes. And further they muſt bee reuenged of their owne fleſh, by ſtraitning and curbing themſelues in their lawfull deſires and delights. Thus of their ſpeciall humiliation: Now ſecondly, they muſt take ſpeciall paines to recouer their faith in God, and to get pardon of their ſinnes, They muſt crie daily vnto God, they muſt ſearch againe and againe in the records of Gods promiſes, eſpecially waiting vpon the preaching of the Goſpell, to ſee when the Lord will returne and haue mercy by reuiuing of their hearts with the comforts of his preſence. And for this they muſt be wonderfull carefull of the ſpirit of grace, to ſtir it vp by daily prayer, and to obſerue with all watchfulneſſe the ſtirring of it, reſoluing with all thankfulneſſe to acknowledge any meaſure of the reuiuing of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when they are in any meaſure recouered, they muſt looke to two things. 1. They muſt forſake all appearance of euill. 2. They muſt vſe a continuall watchfulneſſe, and with feare and iealouſie looke to their hearts, euen in their beſt actions: leaſt Sathan beguile them, and they reuolt againe, and then their caſe of reciduation be worſe then the former, <hi>bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of the loſſe of ſtedfaſtneſſe, eſpecially, as it is in the cureable, for there is a loſſe of ſtedfaſtnes, and the ioy of Gods ſaluation euen in the Elect, which in this life is incureable; Of this I can ſay little, becauſe the Scripture is in this poynt exceeding ſparing, and becauſe the iudgements of God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of this kinde are exceeding deep, who can wade into them? only a word or two of it. This loſſe is incureable two wayes, ſometimes in the croſſe or iudgement it brought vpon the offender, ſometimes in the vnſtedfaſtneſſe it ſelfe; for ſometimes though the Lord reſtore inward ioy and aſſurance, yet hee will not remooue the outward ſigne of his wrath, ſometimes hee drawes backe the outward affliction, but doth not reſtore the inward comfort, or not in ſo great a meaſure, ſo as ſome of Gods children, may die without the ſenſe of the ioy of Gods ſaluation till they come to heauen, yea they may die in greate te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rror and deſpaire: yet the Lord may be reconciled, and they may truely repent, though theſe terrors or iudgements be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed: becauſe God many times will thereby purge the publike ſcandall and cleere his owne iuſtice: Beſides, ſuch ſpectacles doe giue warning to a careleſſe world, to let them know that God hath treaſures of wrath for ſinne if they repent not. Thus of the doctrine of ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith, and vnſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe alſo; now briefely for ſome vſes of it.</p>

We may complaine aſwell of the common Proteſtant, as of the Papiſts heerein, for they are alike aduerſaries to the aſſurance of faith; let ſuch as are touched with feare of God and deſire to beleeue, trauell more and more for attainement heereof, and to this end cleaue to the ſure word of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and labour in the practſe and excerciſe of all holy and Chriſtians graces.</p>
                  <p>And for particular conſideration of the troubles and loſſes of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we may note. 1. That it is a wonderfull fearfull thing to fall into Gods hands, and that the promiſes of God yeeld no protection to a willing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: woe vnto prophane beaſts; if ſinne make God angry towards his owne children, and make them alſo vile before men, then where ſhall thoſe beaſts that wallow in ſinne appeare; if they be iuſtly abaſed that fall once into one ſinne, what ſhall be the confuſion of face and heart in thoſe men, when all the ſinnes they euer committed, ſhall be reueled before Gods Angels, and men

                  <p>IN theſe two verſes the Apoſtle concludes the exhortation begun in the 23. verſe of the former chapter 3 for whereas after all theſe reaſons and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of ſundry obiections, they might finally haue ſayd, tell vs then at once what it is you would haue vs to doe? the Apoſtle anſwers ſummarily, that concerning holy life, hee would haue them walke as they haue receiued the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and concerning faith, hee would haue them to bee rooted and ſoundly edified and eſtabliſhed in the faith, eſpecially to abound in thankfulneſſe to God for their happy eſtate in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>The 6. verſe containes a precept concerning holy life, viz. to walke on in Chriſt, and a rule by which that precept is to be ſquared, and determined, viz. as they haue receiued Chriſt Ieſus the Lord.</p>

To walke as we haue receiued Chriſt, may beare this ſence, namely, to frame our obedience according to the meaſure of the knowledge of Chriſt we haue receiued, it ſhall be to vs according to what we haue, to whom God hath giuen much, of them hee requireth much; and iudgement certainely abideth for him that hath receiued the knowledge of his maſters will, and doth it not, if our practiſe bee according to the knowledge wee haue, this may bee our comfort, God will accept of vs: and otherwiſe they are but in a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſe that are barren and vnfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such a ſenſe as this may be gathered, viz.

Oh this perſeuerance, it is a wonderfull thing, and where is the man that doth not loſe ſomething of what hee had? Oh that wee could bee ſoundly awakened to the care of it, or that wee had mindes that would bee willing to doe any thing wee could to further it: but alas there is not a heart in vs, there are diuers excellent directions in the word to confirme vs heerein, if we were not ouercome with ſluggiſhneſſe.</p>
                  <p>There are diuers things which if they were looked to at our firſt ſetting out, we were ſure to hold out and continue walking in Chriſt. As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Rules for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance to bee obſerued in our firſt conuerſion.</note>If men did at firſt put their hearts to theſe queſtions of abnegation, ſo as they would bee throughly aduiſed, if thou haddeſt asked thine owne heart theſe queſtions; Canſt thou take vp thy croſſe and follow Chriſt? Canſt thou ſuffer aduerſity with the righteous? Canſt thou profeſſe Chriſt admidſt the different opinions of multitudes of men? Canſt thou bee content to denie profit and reaſon, and thy deſires, and pleaſures, and credit, and all for Chriſts ſake? if not, thou wilt certainely fall away, and therefore better neuer beginne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, At mens firſt ſetting out they muſt take heede they bee not ſleightly in their reformation and mortification: but doe it throughly, not ſparing to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their Soules with ſenſible and ſound godly ſorrow: for elſe they will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward repent of their repentance: whereas if it were done with ſound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ſerious humiliation, this would be an vnmooueable foundation of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4894:146"/> reſt and encouragement to faith and well-doing. It is a great queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch will hold out that come in without ſorrow for ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men muſt at firſt looke to their kinde of faith: we ſee many are groſſely deceiued: temporary faith maketh ſuch a ſhew, that vnleſſe it be throughly tried it will deceiue many: and there is a maruellous lothneſſe in our nature to abide the triall, though wee know it be plainly here required<note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note>; whereas if wee did get a continuing faith at firſt, wee might haue the more aſſurance of holding out.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It would much further perſeuerance, if wee did at firſt endeuour, that knowledge and affection might be inſeparable twinnes: not to bee much proud of knowledge without affection, nor to truſt much to zeale without knowledge: either of theſe may be alone in men that will fall away ſhamefully.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When men goe about reformation, they ſhould doe it throughly, and be ſure their hearts are renewed: for the old heart will not hold out long to endure the hardſhip of a reformed life: and if ſome ſinnes haue beene fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſpared, though they lie ſtill for a time, yet afterwards they will reuiue and ſhew themſelues. Wee ſee in ſome, what a doe there is to leaue ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and faults; they are ſeauen yeeres many times before they can bee perſwaded to forgoe them, reſting in the reformation of other faults: whereas there is no aſſurance that they walke with a right foot in the Goſpell, till they make conſcience of a ready reformation of euery knowne ſinne; and till they reforme throughly they are like to fall away, whatſoeuer faire ſhew of zeale and forwardneſſe they make.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In particular diuers men are to be warned of paſſion and violent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if thou meane to proſper in thy perſwaſion of reformation, then ſpeedily <hi>ceaſe from anger, and leaue off wrath,</hi> elſe there will be little hope that thou wilt not returne <hi>to doe euill</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Signes of a true heart.</note>Now the ſignes of a good and true heart are ſuch as theſe: 1.

It loues God with vnfained and vndiuided loue; though it cannot accompliſh all it would, yet it hath holy deſires without hypocriſie, after God, aboue all things. 3. It la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for inward holineſſe as well as outward, both ſeeking the graces that ſhould be within, and mourning for inward ſinnes as well as outward. 4. It will ſmite for ſmall ſinnes, as well for numbring the people, as for murther and whoredome: hee hath not a good and true heart, that is vexed onely for great euils and offences. 5. A true heart is a conſtant heart, it is not fickle and mutable, as many are in all their wayes, but that it is once, it deſires to be alwayes. 6. It deſireth the power of godlineſſe more then the ſhew of it: and is more affected with the praiſe of God then of men. 7. It quickly findes the abſence of Chriſt, and cannot be at reſt till he returne. 8. It conſtantly pronounceth euill of ſinne and ſinners, and well of godlineſſe and good men.</p>
                  <p>Now on the other ſide, the reaſon why many fall away, was becauſe they were not true in their hearts at firſt: they ſet vp a profeſſion of repentance with carnall ends, and through hypocriſie beguiled themſelues and others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if men finde that they haue beene rightly formed in the wombe and birth of their change, then there are other directions for them to obſerue, throughout their liues, that they might continue in this holy walking with God and his Saints.<note place="margin">Rules to bee looked vnto after our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> Wouldeſt thou be ſure not to fall away? Then looke to theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be ſure thou continue in the carefull vſe of the meanes, as the word, praier, conference and Sacraments, elſe know that when once thou giueſt way to a cuſtomarie hardneſſe of heart in the vſe of the meanes, or neglect of them, thou art neere either ſome great ſinne or temptation, or ſome great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4894:147"/> iudgment and apoſtacie; and therefore concerning the meanes principally looke to two things, 1. preſerue appetite. 2. practiſe that thou heareſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out omiſſion or delay.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou diſcerne any ſpirituall weakneſſe or decay, or feele any combat with the fleſh, or the tentations of Satan, be ſure thou complaine betimes, and reſiſt at the firſt, for then <hi>the grace of God will be ſufficient,</hi> and the weapons of our warfare mightie through God: praier will eaſily maſter ſinne at the firſt through the victorie in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Reſolue with thy ſelfe not to let goe thy aſſurance, or caſt away the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of thy hope whatſoeuer befall thee: or at leaſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36.</note> not till thou maieſt ſee wonderfull euident reaſon. It is a maruellous great fault, to call the loue of God into queſtion vpon euery occaſion, whereas men cannot glorifie God more then to liue by faith, and to be vnmoueable in it: God takes little delight in a ſoule that will withdraw it ſelfe vpon euery occaſion by vnbeleefe. Are they not ſtrangely fooliſh, that will weare their helmets when there is no ſtirre, and as ſoone as they ſee an aduerſarie, or any blowes towards, then to caſt away their helmet, and doe it ſo vſually? Such are we and worſe, that ſtand bragging of our faith and hope in proſperitie and eaſe, and when affliction and temptation comes, then moſt childiſhly we caſt away both faith &amp; hope, and till reaſon and ſenſe are ſatisfied, we will not be perſwaded.</p>

Of this ſtedfaſtneſſe I haue at large intreated in the 5. verſe. Onely wee may here againe be inſtructed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the neceſſitie and excellencie of ſtedfaſtneſſe: The Apoſtle would not thus often peale vpon it, but that hee knew it to be of ſingular worth in the life of man, and of great neceſſitie vnto our conſolation; beſides it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that people are for the moſt part ſlow-hearted herein, and hardly drawne to the vnfained and diligent labour after the eſtabliſhing of their faith and aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all this ſtedfaſtneſſe of aſſurance is not the worke of a day; a great tree is not growne or rooted but ſucceſſiuely; a great houſe is not built all at once; we muſt be euery day adding ſomething to Gods worke, that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of grace may be in due time finiſhed: none are ſo eſtabliſhed, but they may grow in faith; none haue ſuch great roots, but they may take root yet more: many men ſtriue hard to make their trees ſhew in branches and leaues, I meane in outward profeſſion in the world, but alas what ſhould this great bulke, and ſo many branches and leaues doe, vnleſſe there were more roots within? Yea many deare children of God miſtake wonderfully; they euery

                  <p>Here diuers things may be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the people ſhould labour for a reuerend eſtimation of the doctrine they receiue from their faithfull teachers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as faith commeth by hearing, ſo doth the eſtabliſhment of faith alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is wonderfull dangerous to neglect either the charge of our teachers when they vrge vs to aſſurance, or the rules by which they guide vs out of the word of God, for the attainment of it; if wee would goe about it when our teachers call vpon vs, the Lord would be with his ordinance to bleſſe it to vs; wee ſhould be afraid to delay, when we are taught how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our ſoules in faith and grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The faithfull Miniſters doe greatly labour to eſtabliſh their hearers in the aſſurance of Gods fauour, and the duties of holy life.</p>

                  <p>In theſe words the Apoſtle ſhuts vp all, wherein his intent is to ſtirre them vp to thankfulneſſe, that as they did thriue in the meanes or matter of faith and holy life, ſo they ſhould glorifie God by all poſſible thankfulneſſe for it: as he would haue them abound in faith and holineſſe, ſo alſo in thankfulneſſe to God. This may wonderfully ſmite our hearts: for if we obſerue our wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched euill diſpoſitions, wee may finde that wee are wonderfully bent to the very habit of vnthankfulneſſe: and therefore it is iuſt with God many times, that we doe no more thriue in victorie ouer our corruptions, or in the power of diuers graces, or in the progreſſe of duties, becauſe wee doe not more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and conſtantly acknowledge the goodneſſe of God we haue had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of. Oh that it were written vpon our hearts, and grauen deepe in our memories, that nothing becomes vs more then to abound in thankfulneſſe, no fairer ſight then to ſee the Altar of the Lord couered with the calues of our lips; neuer can the eſtate of a childe of God be ſuch, but hee hath exceeding great cauſe of thankfulneſſe for his happineſſe in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>It is vaine deceit foure wayes. 1. When it propoundeth and teacheth deuilliſh things, as the Philoſophie of the Pagans did: As in their Magickes, when they taught the diuers kindes of Southſayings, coniurings, caſting of natiuities, and a great part of Iudiciall Aſtrologie. 2. When the placets and opinions of Philoſophers that are falſe, are iuſtified as true: As their doctrine of the worlds eternitie, or the ſoules mortalitie, or the worſhip of Angels, or their Stoicall fate and deſtinie, or their vilde opinions about the chiefe good. 3. When the principles of philoſophie, that in the ordinary courſe of nature are in themſelues true, are abuſed to denie things propounded in the Goſpell aboue nature: As thoſe maximes, that of nothing nothing is made: And that of a priuation to a habit there is no regreſſion, and that a Virgin cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. The firſt is brought againſt the creation of God, whereas it is true of the ſecond cauſe only. So the ſecond is brought againſt the reſurrection, whereas it is true only in the ordinary courſe of nature. 4. When the trueſt and beſt things in philoſophie are vrged, as neceſſary to ſaluation, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as meet to be ioyned with the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Philoſophie may yet be vſed, ſo as ſhe be content to be a ſeruant, not a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. If when Gods word reueales any thing abſurd in her, that then ſhee will humble her ſelfe, and acknowledge her blindneſſe, and bee admoniſhed by diuine light. And on the other ſide, men may be corrupted with philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,<note place="margin">When men are corrupted by philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</note> and that diuers wayes. 1. If men vſe any part of philoſophie that is deuilliſh, as too many doe. 2. If men neglect the ſtudie of the Scriptures, and ſpend their time onely in thoſe humane ſtudies. 3. When men mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all doctrine by humane reaſon and philoſophicall poſitions. 4. When men depend not vpon God, but vpon ſecond cauſes. 5. When men ſtriue to yoake mens conſciences with the plauſible words of mens wiſedome. Hence alſo we may note, that falſe doctrine may be ſupported with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of wiſdome and learning, as was the corruption of thoſe falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Wee may not thinke that Papiſts are fooles, and can ſay nothing for their religion: but if the Lord ſhould let vs fall into their hands to trie vs, wee muſt expect from diuers of them great ſhewes of learning &amp; colours of truth.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4894:149"/> ſo the doctrine of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, and of the Patriarkes before the Law, was firſt deliuered by tradition.

                  <p>There is another diſtinction about traditions, and that is this. 1. Some things are founded vpon Scripture, and did alwaies tend to further godlineſſe,<note place="margin">A diſtinction about traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and are therefore Apoſtolicall, and to be obſerued: as all the doctrines of the word, and the publike aſſemblies of praier and preaching. 2. Some things were founded in Scripture, and were ſometimes profitable, but now are out of all needfull vſe: and therefore though they be Apoſtolicall, yet they binde not, as the tradition of abſtaining from things ſacrificed to Idols, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and bloud. 3. Some things haue not foundation in the word, yet may further pietie, if vſed without ſuperſtition, and therefore not vnlawfull, as the obſeruation of the Feaſt of the Natiuitie of Chriſt, and ſuch like. 4. Some things haue no foundation in Scripture, nor doe at all further pietie, but are either light or vnneceſſary, or repugnant to the word, thoſe are ſimply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p>Traditions were both in the Church of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Traditions in the Church of the Iewes.</note> and in the Churches of the Gentiles; the Iewiſh traditions were called the traditions of the Elders, not becauſe they were enioyned them by their Sanadrim or Colledge of Elders, but becauſe they were brought in by their fathers after the captiuitie, the moſt of them after the riſing of the ſect of the Phariſies. For among them was that diſtinction, of the Law written, and the Law by word of mouth: this Law by word of mouth is the <hi>Cabaliſticall Theologie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cabaliſticall Diuinitie.</note> a Diuinitie ſo greatly in requeſt amongſt the Phariſies; but how well our Sauiour Chriſt liked thoſe traditions may appeare, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The traditions in the Churches of the Gentiles<note place="margin">Traditions in the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> may be conſidered two wayes. 1. As they were in the times of the Primitiue Church. 2. As they were in the times after, vnder Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the Primitiue Church they had by degrees one after another a great number of traditions: ſuch as theſe; To ſtand and pray euery Sabboth from Eaſter to Whitſontide; The ſigne of the Croſſe; to pray towards the Eaſt; the anointing of the baptized with oyle; the canonicall houres; Lent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes of faſts; the mixing of water with wine; the addition of diuers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, as Canons, Exorciſts, Oſtiaries, &amp;c. Holidaies; to ſing <hi>Halleluiah</hi> at Eaſter, but not in Lent, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Now if any aske what we are to thinke of thoſe and the like traditions then in vſe, I anſwer:<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſw.</note> 1. That the Church had power to appoint tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in indifferent rites, ſo that the rules of the Apoſtles for indifferent things were obſerued, as that they were not offenſiue, nor againſt order, or decencie, or edification. As to appoint the time and place of publike praier, to ſet downe the forme of it, to tell how often the Sacraments ſhould bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt vnderſtand that the word <hi>Traditions</hi> vſed by the Fathers,<note place="margin">Traditions in the times of the Fathers in the primitiue Church.</note> did not alwayes ſignifie theſe and ſuch like things deuiſed by men, but ſometimes they did meane thereby ſuch things as were warranted by Scripture, though not expreſſely. As the baptizing of Infants, the obſeruation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There were ſome Traditions in ſome Churches, in the firſt hundred of yeeres, that were directly impious, as the Inuocation of Saints, and Images</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some other things were then vſed that were not euery way impious in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4894:150"/> their owne nature, and yet not greatly iuſtifiable in their vſe, and ſuch were diuers of the aforenamed obſeruations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That diuers things at the firſt brought into the Church with good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and to good purpoſe, afterwards grew into abuſe: as for example; In the Primitiue order of Monkes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The worſer traditions were brought in by falſe teachers, and too perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly obſerued by the people, the Fathers bewailing it, and ſometimes complaining of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Fathers themſelues in ſome things ſhewed leuitie and vnconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of iudgement: ſometimes to pleaſe the people, approuing things; and againe, ſometimes ſtanding vpon the ſole perfection of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it cannot well be denied, but that the libertie taken in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue times to bring in traditions, opened a doore to Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Traditions in Poperie.</note>Now concerning the traditions in Popery vnder Antichriſt, their doctrine is abominable, for they ſay that the word of God is either written or vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and they ſay their vnwritten verities are neceſſary as well as Scripture, yea that they are of equall authoritie with Scripture. And thoſe traditions they would thus exalt,<note place="margin">Scriptures againſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> are for number many, for nature childiſh, vnprofitable, impious and idolatrous.

                  <p>To conclude this diſcourſe concerning traditions, we muſt further vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the traditions in any Church though they be things indifferent in their owne nature, become vnlawfull, if they be ſuch as be taxed in theſe eight rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If they be contrary to the rules of the Apoſtles concerning ſuch things eccleſiaſtically indifferent. 2. If they bee vrged and vſed with ſuperſtition.<note place="margin">8. Wayes any tradition grovves euill.</note> 3. Or as any parts of Gods worſhip. 4. Or with opinion of merit. 5. Or as neceſſary to ſaluation. 6. Or if they be equalled with the Law of God, or the weightie things of the Law, neglected, and thoſe more vrged. 7. If they be light and childiſh. Laſtly, if by their multitude they darken and obſcure the glory of Chriſt in his ordinances. Thus of the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>The third thing from which hee doth dehort is the Rudiments of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Rudiments of the world.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Rudiments of the world he meaneth the lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What hee meanes by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</note> eſpecially concerning meats, waſhings, holidayes, garments, and ſuch like ceremoniall obſeruations.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe lawes were called Rudiments or Elements, as ſome thinke,<note place="margin">Why called rudiments.</note> becauſe the Iewes and falſe Apoſtles held them as needfull as the foure elements of the world: or elſe becauſe in their firſt inſtitution they did ſignifie the moſt choice and fundamentall principles of the Goſpell, that were neceſſary for all to know that would be ſaued; but it is moſt likely they are called ſo by a Grammaticall relation to the Abcedaries, that as little children beginne at the Alphabet, and ſo goe on to higher ſtudies, ſo did the Lord giue thoſe lawes, as the A. B. C. of the Iewes, to be their Paedagogie, in the infancie of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now they might be ſaid to be <hi>of the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why of the world.</note> becauſe they were externall rites and ſubiect to the ſight and ſenſe; and becauſe they conſiſted of a glory that was more worldly then ſpirituall, and becauſe worldly men doe moſt ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is externall.</p>
                  <p>Tis the drift of the Apoſtle to diſſwade from the obſeruation of thoſe rites, becauſe now the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was abrogated. Abrogation is a plauſible doctrine in popular eſtates. Proclamation concerning immunities from tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and taxations, or concerning Iſonomie, that is, indifferent libertie for all to be competitors for honors, or free for profits of a common-wealth, thoſe were wont to be wonderfull gratefull to the multitude: and ſuch is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of abrogation in Diuinitie: yet becauſe it may be abuſed by Epicures, it is to be more carefully opened.</p>
                  <p>The Law may be ſaid to be abrogated diuers wayes.<note place="margin">The law ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated 4. wayes.</note> 1. When it is anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated or obſolete, ſo as men are neither bound to dutie nor puniſhment: and thus the ceremonies are abrogated. 2. When the puniſhment is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, onely the obedience ſtill remaining in force, as in the law of ſtealth. 3. It is abrogated to the guiltie, when the puniſhment is transferred on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as the law cannot exerciſe herforce vpon the guiltie perſon. 4. It is abrogated, when it is weakened and eneruated by tranſgreſſors: to breake the Law is to looſe or diſſolue the Law; thus wicked men by their liues abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> abrogated? <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for though <hi>Moſes</hi> be ſaid to giue place to Chriſt, that doth not import a change of the Law, but of the Law-giuer. <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue three kindes of Lawes, Morall, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall, Ceremoniall.</p>
                  <p>For the Morall Law, it may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be abrogated,<note place="margin">How the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.2.</note> as 1. In reſpect of the curſe and malediction, as it did worke anger and made execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for ſo <hi>there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> in as much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4894:151"/> as the <hi>law of the ſpirit of life hath freed them from the law of ſinne and death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</note> 2. In reſpect of the inexorable rigour and perfection of it: for wee are not now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, but vnder grace. 3. In ſome ſenſe it is abrogated in reſpect of iuſtification: for now it is no more required of the godly, that they ſhould ſeeke iuſtification by the law, but by Ieſus Chriſt. Againe, we muſt diſtinguiſh of the perſons: for the law ſtill lieth on the necke of the vnregenerate, but in the former reſpects is abrogated to the faithfull,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. How the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Lawes are abrogated</note> for againſt them there is no law, but the law is giuen to the vnrighteous.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Iudiciall lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were as it were ciuill lawes, concerning Magiſtrates, Inheritance, order and proceſſe of Iudgements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, mariage, bondage, diuorce, vowes, vſurie, and treſpaſſe betweene man and man.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Iudiciall lawes muſt be conſidered two wayes. 1. As they binde the Iewes as they were men, that is, in a common and generall right, and ſo thoſe lawes are perpetuall in the nature and equitie of them. 2. As they bound the Iewes as they were Iewes, in a perſonall, nationall, or ſingular right: and thus where the reaſon of a law is particular, there the law is ſo, and bindes not other people, but as it may fit their Common-wealths.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremoniall lawes did concerne ſacrifices, and ſacraments, and other holy things, and rituall obſeruations. Diuines haue a ſaying, that <hi>the Iudicials</hi> are <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>the Ceremonials</hi> are <hi>deadly.</hi> That the Ceremonies are abrogated, was ſignified by the renting of the vaile of the Temple, yea the Temple it ſelfe is deſtroied, as will more fully appeare when I come to the 15. verſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus of the rudiments of the world. Hitherunto alſo of the matter of the dehortation. The reaſons follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And not after Chriſt.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words containe the firſt reaſon againſt philoſophie, traditions and ceremonies: they are not after Chriſt, and therefore to be auoided, leſt our ſoules be ſpoiled. Theſe things were not after Chriſt, 1. becauſe they no way tended to the furtherance of heauen and reconciliation with God, which in Chriſt we ſhould principally looke to. 2. Becauſe they were no way warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or approued, or commanded by Chriſt: Chriſt when he came impoſed no ſuch things. 3. Becauſe they doe now no way leade vs after Chriſt, but from him rather, inaſmuch as we reſt in thoſe workes done, and neglect the commandement of God. Laſtly, they feed the humours of carnall men, and draw away mens mindes from the ſpirituall worſhip of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may note an anſwer to that queſtion, whether the Gentiles may not be ſaued without Chriſt by philoſophie? The Apoſtle determines that the ſoule is ſpoiled by philoſophie, if it be not after Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, hence we may learne a note of triall concerning the truth of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: that religion which is not after Chriſt, is a falſe religion: for this is a foundation, that euerlaſting happineſſe muſt be expected from Chriſt alone.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here we may note, that ſinnes againſt Chriſt will be accounted for, though they were not forbidden in the morall law. We haue now another law in the Goſpell, ſo as whatſoeuer is not after Chriſt is a great tranſgreſſion: neither may we thinke that we ſinne not againſt Chriſt but only by traditions and ceremonies; for there are many other wayes of offending againſt him, as, To liue without Chriſt and communion with him<note n="a" place="margin">

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THeſe words containe the ſecond reaſon: and it ſtands thus; If in Chriſt there be all diuine fulnes &amp; ſufficiencie, then there needs no ſupply from humane inuentions, either for doctrine, or worſhip, or manners: but in Chriſt there dwels all fulneſſe euen from the ocean of all perfection, and therefore let no man ſpoile you through philoſophie, traditions or ceremonies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the explication of the Minor, wee may conceiue of the words of the text thus; There is in Chriſt all fulneſſe of wiſdome as the Prophet of the Church, therefore there needs no philoſophie. 2. There is all fulneſſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Chriſts ſatisfaction as Prieſt of the Church, therefore there needs no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating ceremonies. 3. There is all fulneſſe of power and efficacie in Chriſt as King of the Church, therefore there is no need that wee ſhould helpe him with inuenting traditions to vphold the liues or godlineſſe of Chriſtians, or any way to further the ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This verſe containes in it ſelfe an excellent propoſition concerning Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Godhead is in the body, that is, in the humane nature of Chriſt; and this is amplified, 1. by the manner of preſence, <hi>hee dwelleth there.</hi> 2. by the meaſure, <hi>in all fulneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Corporally</hi> hath beene diuerſly interpreted. <hi>Corporally,</hi> that is, truly and indeed. <hi>Corporally,</hi> that is, not in ſhew or ſhadow onely, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, in compariſon of the ſhadowes of the law, or prefiguring ſignes. He dwelleth not in Chriſt as he did in the Temple. <hi>Corporally,</hi> that is, according to the fleſh. <hi>Corporally,</hi> in reſpect of the manner of his preſence, not as hee is in all creatures by efficacie or power, nor as hee is in the Saints by his grace, nor as he is in the bleſſed by glory, but corporally, that is, by vnion with the perſon of the word: but I thinke it is ſafeſt and plaineſt, to take it in the third ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> corporally, that is, in his humane nature.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is commended in the praiſe of his relation 1. to the Godhead, in this verſe, 2. to Saints and Angels, verſ. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In him,</hi> notes his perſon; <hi>Godhead,</hi> expreſſeth his diuine nature; <hi>corporally,</hi> imports his humane nature; and <hi>dwels,</hi> tels vs of the vnion of the natures.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of all is, that in as much as the Lord hath ſaued vs by ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſaluation in Chriſt, and in that our Sauiour was true God as well as man, as being the ſecond perſon in Trinitie,<note place="margin">Why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vvas the ſecond perſon in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and no other.</note> therefore we ſhould wholly reſt vpon him, and not diſtract our thoughts, or faith, or ſeruices, with either phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, or traditions, or ceremonies, as ſuppoſing that our ſaluation ſhould be any wayes furthered by thoſe. Now in that the holy Ghoſt is ſo carefull to teach the diuinitie of Chriſt, wee ſhould alſo learne to be affected with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that hath deſigned the ſecond perſon in Trinitie to be our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: Thinke of it often, and weigh with your ſelfe the glory of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome herein; who is fitter to reſtore the world then he that made it<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can the whole diuine nature be ſaid to be in the humane, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one is infinite, the other finite?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is no more then to affirme, that the humane nature is vnited to the diuine in the fulneſſe of it. Or 2. That it is incorporate, or made fleſh incarnate, or hath a body ioyned to it. Or elſe 3. Let it be granted of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation in the fleſh of Chriſt: yet it followeth not that therefore it is there included. For it is ſo in the fleſh whole, that without the fleſh it is euery where. For the diuinitie is not only immenſe that it can be euery where, but alſo moſt ſimple, that it can be and be euery where whole, as the ſoule in the body, and the light is in the Sunne, and yet not included there, yet truly and whole there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſince this text plainly affirmes that Chriſt had a body, and ſo by <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> a true humane nature, it may be here enquired whether his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was like ours, and the rather ſince the Godhead did dwell in him bodily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How Chriſt was like vs, &amp; how vnlike.</note>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That this may be cleerely reſolued, wee muſt know that what is ſaid in this verſe notwithſtanding, Chriſt in his humane nature was like vnto vs. But for euidence, I ſhew briefly in what he was like, and then in what he was not like. He was like 1. in that he tooke a true body, not fantaſticall. 2. He tooke a true humane body, and not a celeſtiall body, and he was endued with a reaſonable ſoule. 3. Hee had the eſſentiall faculties of both. 4. He had the very infirmities of our nature, I meane ſuch as were not ſinfull. Now Chriſt was vnlike vs in body, in ſoule, in both: <hi>In body:</hi> 1. In his conception there was a difference; for we are of <hi>Adam,</hi> and by <hi>Adam,</hi> but he was of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not by <hi>Adam,</hi> for he was not begotten, but made: and ſo originall ſinne was auoided, and ſome thinke his very body had all the parts at the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4894:152"/> formed. 2. His body was not corruptible, it ſaw no corruption. In ſoule he differed two waies. 1. In that it was without ſinne. 2. In that it was indued with gifts aboue men and Angels. In both there was difference. For 1. They ſubſiſted from the beginning in the diuine nature, and did not make a perſon of themſelues. 2. They are admitted vnto the grace of adoration, ſo as now Chriſt-man is worſhipped though not properly as he is man.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the natures of Chriſt: the vnion of them followes, in a double conſideration. 1. Of the manner, in the word <hi>dwell.</hi> 2. Of the meaſure <hi>in all fulneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dwell]</hi> There are two kindes of vnions in Chriſt. 1. Of the ſoule and body. 2. Of both thoſe with the perſon of the word, the latter is here meant.</p>
                  <p>There are 2. queſtions about vnion in Theologie,<note place="margin">Diſtinctions of vnions.</note> that are wonderfull full of difficultie. 1. The vnion of three perſons in one nature. 2. The vnion of two natures in one perſon. This latter is in Chriſt, he is begotten as God, created in reſpect of his ſoule, and borne in reſpect of his body.</p>
                  <p>There are diuers vnions. 1. Subſtantiall in the Trinitie. 2. Naturall in ſoule and body. 3. Carnall in man and wife. 4. Myſticall in Chriſt and the Church. 5. Perſonall in Chriſt, for in him as ſoule and body are one man, ſo God and man are one Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is much eaſier to tell how this vnion in Chriſt is not then to tell how it is. Negatiuely thus.</p>
                  <p>Things are vnited three waies; Some things are compounded and made one, yet the things vnited are not changed, mingled, or confounded, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine perfect: as many ſtones vnited in one building. 2. Some things vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are perfect, but yet changed and not what they were: as the body of a man made of the vnion of the foure elements. 3. Some things remaine whole and not changed but vnperfect of themſelues, as the ſoule and body of themſelues apart. Now this vnion of Chriſt is not after any of theſe waies. Againe this vnion in Chriſt is. 1. Not by bare aſſiſtance or preſence<note n="o" place="margin">

For the houſholder and the houſe cannot be fitly called one.</p>
                  <p>The effects of this vnion may be conſidered either as they are in Chriſt or to vs ward.</p>
                  <p>In Chriſt, from this vnion ſlowes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The predication of the things of each nature, to the perſon and that truely and really, as when his bloud is ſaid to be the bloud of the Sonne of God<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Theſe gifts in Chriſt they were either naturall or ſupernaturall,<note place="margin">Gifts naturall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in Chriſt.</note> by naturall gifts I meane ſuch as theſe; in the minde, the beſt wit or memorie and ſuch like faculties, better then euer were in any man, I except not <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe.

In the ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.

                  <p>Of the firſt ſort I propound theſe, 1. In the whole ſoule ſo great holines as can be imagined to befall a creature. 2. In the minde, moſt exquiſite wiſedome. 3.

                  <p>Now amongſt all theſe I only conſider of his wiſedome and power.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A twofold wiſedome in Chriſt.</note>There was a twofold wiſedome in Chriſt. <hi>Increate,</hi> and that was onely in his diuine nature; and <hi>create,</hi> and that was in his humane.

Knowledge by immediate viſion<note n="y" place="margin">

                        <hi>Luk</hi> 2 52.</note>. By the firſt knowledge he knoweth immediately the word or God, to which his humane nature is vnited, and in God as in a glaſſe he ſees all other things. Thus he ſees God face to face, and this is a certaine created light in the ſoule by participation of diuine light.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this firſt ſort of knowledge in Chriſt, ſtrange things are ſaid by Diuines, but the ſumme of all is this: 1. That the ſoule of Chriſt by this created light and viſion ſees God, and that firſt, Whole: ſecondly, Perfectly. 2. That in this viſion he ſees all things.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Solut.</hi> Not ſo. For firſt, though he ſee God whole yet he ſeeth him not wholy<note n="b" place="margin">

Though hee know the thinges that are and ſhall be, yet, he knowes not ſuch things as ſhall not be, and yet God can doe them. 3. What he doth know by this finite light, he knowes not ſo plainely as the word doth. 4. It ſeeth not things at one view or altogether, but one thing after another. Thus of his immediate or bleſſed knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond kinde of knowledge is habituall or infuſed knowledge. By this knowledge, he knowes all that can be knowne of man or Angels, yea of all of them together, of this he ſpeakes <hi>Eſay.</hi> 11.3. There are foure wordes to expreſſe it, <hi>wiſedome, vnderſtanding, knowledge,</hi> and <hi>counſell;</hi> by the firſt hee vnderſtandeth celeſtiall &amp; diuine things; by the ſecond things ſeparate from matter, as the Angels; by the third things naturall; and by the laſt things to be done. But this knowledge is much inferiour to the former, for thus hee knowes not the diuine eſſence. Of experimentall knowledge the holy Ghoſt ſpake <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. when he ſaid <hi>Ieſus increaſed in wiſedome,</hi> and that muſt needs be in ſuch knowledge as he got by obſeruation by degrees in the world. Thus of the wiſedome of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the power of Chriſt<note place="margin">Of the power of Chriſt.</note> many things are controuerted in other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4894:153"/> Churches: and I haue ſpoken of it before, more then men of wrangling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and corrupt and enuious mindes did well take, though no more then what is ordinarie in the writings of learned men: I ſhall not need therefore to ſay much of it in this place. The power of Chriſt is twofold, <hi>increate</hi> and <hi>create.</hi> Increated power, is the power of his diuine nature, and ſo he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent. Created power is an admirable force in the humane nature of Chriſt, aboue man or Angels, to accompliſh that vnto which it is directed. By his diuine power, Chriſt worketh diuine things, and by his humane power, hee worketh humane things, thus is hee powerfull aboue all creatures, in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, memorie, will, and in acting whatſoeuer the Law of God can will.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the power of Chriſt: and ſo of the gifts in the ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtate of exaltation, there befell Chriſt 4. things. 1. a wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of glory. 2. the grace of adoration with the diuine nature. 3. the power of adminiſtration of all things in heauen and earth<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</note>. 4. a iudiciarie power, viz. to be the Iudge of the whole world<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſecond effect.</p>
                  <p>The third effect of this vnion in Chriſt, was his mediatorſhip, as remaining perfect God he became man; ſo without any mutation of himſelfe, he is by this vnion become perfect mediator betweene God and man, the true high Prieſt, and the only head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt effect of this vnion, is the communion of the effects: there are diuers operations of both natures, yet they meet in one work done: the worker is the perſon; the fountaines of operation, are the two natures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their properties: the actions are ſome proper to the diuine nature, ſome to the humane, yet the outward fact or thing effected is the worke of both natures. Thus of the effects of this vnion in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the effects that flow to vs from hence, are either in Chriſt for vs, or in vs by Chriſt. In Chriſt for vs, there are two effects, expiation and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the father. In vs by Chriſt are three effects, iuſtification, ſanctification and glorification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In all fulneſſe]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vbiquitaries doe abuſe this place, for they alleage that this place proues, that the eſſentiall properties of the diuine nature are communicated really to the humane, and ſo they ſay Chriſt is in his humane nature omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, euery where preſent and omniſcient: this they fall vpon to eſtabliſh his reall preſence in the ſacrament. But that this place cannot fit their turnes, may appeare by theſe reaſons, 1. He ſaith, <hi>in whom,</hi> that is, in which perſon the Godhead dwells &amp;c. now it is not doubted by any, but that the perſon of Chriſt is omnipotent, euery where preſent &amp;c. 2. Be it, <hi>in which body</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells &amp;c. yet this proues nothing for them, for ſo hee dwells in the Saints, and yet they doe not ſay, they are euery where preſent. 3. When he ſaith, <hi>all fulnes,</hi> this <hi>fulnes</hi> notes the eſſence as well as the properties: now I hope they will not ſay the eſſence is wholly communicated to the body of Chriſt. 4. <hi>All fulneſſe</hi> imports all attributes as well as ſome, now all attributes are not communicated: as for example, the body of Chriſt was not eternall. Laſtly, the ſame was cleared before, the fulnes of the Godhead is there as the light is in the ſunne.</p>
                  <p>From the conſideration of all which doctrine,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note> we may ſee cauſe to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and confounded in our ſelues, that we ſhould not more admire the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull glory of the perſon of Chriſt: and for the time to come, wee ſhould heartily ſtriue with God by praier, and the vſe of all good meanes, that hee would be pleaſed <hi>to reueale his ſonne in vs,</hi> and ſhew this rich myſterie of <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> Laſtly, this ſhould confirme vs in the faith of all the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4894:154"/> good things promiſed in the Meſſiah, ſeeing hence wee know how infinitely compleat he is in himſelfe. Thus of the 9. verſe.</p>

Angells are moſt ſpirituall creatures without bodies: they moue like the winde vnreſiſtably, eaſily without moleſtation, and in an vnperceiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time: and for their number, I am not of their fond opinion that thinke they are meant in the parable of the 99. ſheep, as if they were ſo infinite beyond the number of mankinde: yet without queſtion, their number is exceeding

They wonderfully excell in knowledge, and that naturall, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, and experimentall. But to ſpeake a little more expreſly, I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Angels, 1. What they are in themſelues, here called <hi>principalities</hi> and <hi>powers.</hi> 2. What they are in relation to Chriſt, who is ſaid here to bee their <hi>head.</hi> 3. What they be in reference to the body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Angels in themſelues are principalities, for their excellencie of nature and eſtate. They are called powers for their wonderfull force they haue ouer other creatures at Gods appointment. The words doe not import any hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie among the Angels, for howſoeuer we are not to thinke there is any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxie among thoſe glorious creatures; ſo it hath beene bold preſumption in thoſe either Iewes or Scholemen or Papiſts that haue trauelled in it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a fantaſticall number of orders amongſt them. For their excellencie of nature, as they are here called principalities, ſo elſe where they are called, <hi>ſtarres of the morning, ſonnes of God,</hi> yea <hi>Gods</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Elohim.</note>. And for their power it is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ouer the creatures: as when an Angell could deſtroy all the firſt borne of Egypt, and to ouerthrowe ſo many thouſand in <hi>Senacharibs</hi> armie: an Angell ſet <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, an Angell caried <hi>Philip</hi> in an inſtant, they can ſtrangely winde themſelues into mens imaginations, ſo as they can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to men in their dreames<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 1.</note>. As euill Angels can ſuggeſt tentations, ſo do good Angels holy motions. They haue power ouer the Deuils to reſtrain them, but worke miracles they cannot but by the power of God; the Angell in the 8. of <hi>Iohn</hi> could moue the waters, but hee could not of himſelfe cure the ſicke. Thus of Angels in themſelues.</p>
                  <p>In relation to Chriſt ſo they are implied to be of the body, and Chriſt to be their head. Now we may not maruell at it that Chriſt ſhould be the head of Angels, for there be diuers diſtinct benefits which Angels from thence do receiue,<note place="margin">The benefits Angels haue by Chriſt.</note> which by naturall creation they had not. It is a benefit that they are vouchſafed a place in the myſticall body vnder Chriſt that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as it were into the new order in Chriſt. 2. A peace is made betweene them and man in Chriſt. 3. The roomes of Angels falne are ſupplied by the elect, the ſociety of Angels being much maimed by their fall. 4. They are refreſhed with ſingular ioy for the conuerſion of the elect,; beſides the inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their knowledge, that they are vouchſafed the vnderſtanding of the ſecrets of the Goſpell. 5. They receiue from Chriſt confirming grace, and ſo aſſurance that they ſhall neuer fall: which is their cheife benefit. 6. Their obedience in it owne nature is vnperfect<note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.</note>, though not ſinfull, and therefore may need to be couered by Chriſts perfections.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the relation to Chriſt. Now if any aske what relation they haue to the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">What the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe for the body of Chriſt.</note> and what they doe vnto it: I anſwere, by propounding both what ſeruice they do to the body, and in what manner. For the firſt, they are like Maſters and Tutors to whom the great King of heauen ſends out his children to nurſe.

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 18.10.</note>. Now for the manner in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament they are reported to haue ſometimes appeared vnto men, ſomtimes in their dreames, ſometimes in viſions, the Prophets being rauiſhed, into an extaſie, without true bodies, but not without the forme of bodies. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they appeared in true bodies, either ſuch as were for the time created of nothing, or elſe formed for the ſeruice of ſome preexiſting matter, or elſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4894:155"/> they vſed the bodies of ſome liuing creatures: for if the Deuill could ſpeake in the Serpent, why might not ſome good Angell vſe other Creatures: as ſome thinke the Angell ſpake in Balaams Aſſe. But for this kinde of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues to men in the new Teſtament it is ceaſed, eſpecially ſince the primitiue times, ſo as now we cannot deſcribe how the Angels doe performe their ſeruice to the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now for the vſe of the whole, in as much Chriſt is the head of principalities and powers, we may comfort our ſelues diuers waies. If Chriſt fill the Angels, how much more can he out of his fulneſſe fill vs, in the ſupplie of all our wants? againe, ſhall we not reioyce in the grace here is done to vs, in that wee are vnited into communion with Angels vnder our head? yea and that ſuch glorious creatures, are appointed to be our attendants, why ſhould wee feare when Chriſt and his Angels will be ſo ready about vs? further this may alſo inſtruct vs, we neede not be aſhamed of Chriſts ſeruice, ſeeing the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels follow him and depend vpon him. A prince that kept great princes to be his domeſticall ſeruants, were like to be much ſought to for preferment of ſuch as would follow him? Oh how ſhould we long after Chriſt who is head ouer ſuch glorious creatures as the Angels are?</p>

                  <p>Circumciſion had a double ſignification, for partly it looked to Chriſt, and partly to the members of Chriſt. As it looked to Chriſt it ſignified 1. That they ſhould haue a Sauiour that was circumciſed, that is free from all ſinne.

That he ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for ſinne by effuſion of bloud, for all bloud in the old Teſtament was tipicall. Now as it looked to man, it ſignified. 1. That by carnall generation we were vncleane, and out of couenant with God. 2. That the faithfull haue intereſt in the bleſſed ſeed. 3. That our hearts muſt be circumciſed, by the painefull mortification of ſinne, and the painefull caſting away of ſin, as a wretched fore-skin: and that wee ſhould ſuffer affliction of ſpirit for ſin, till our hearts were as ſore, as were the <hi>Shecchemites</hi> bodies. 4. That wee are adopted into Gods fauour and communion with Saints, and diſtinguiſhed from all other men. 5.

Now that there is ſuch a worke as this in euery childe of God, is apparant by theſe places of Scripture, Deut. 10.16. &amp; 30.6. Ier. 4.4. Rom. 2.26. and this text.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing here to be conſidered is the perſons both in themſelues, <hi>ye,</hi> and in their relation to Chriſt, <hi>in whom,</hi> and to other gifts mentioned before, and imported in the word <hi>alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye]</hi> What graces we heare to be in Chriſts members, we muſt looke to it, that they be in vs: it was no comfort to the Coloſſians that others were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed with circumciſion without hands, vnleſſe it might be truely ſo ſaid of them alſo. Which ſerues for great reproofe of many that neglect the power of all doctrine, which is the application of it to themſelues. but this comes to paſſe either for want of faith<note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1.</note>, or through preiudice<note n="o" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>In whom]</hi> Circumciſion without hands is onely found in ſuch as are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Chriſt, they only wound corruption of nature, and caſt away beloued ſinnes with ſorrow, this is the difference betweene temporarie faith and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith. There are three ſorts of hearers in the Citie, Some wholly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, ſuch as will mend nothing, nor like to heare of mending. Some open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincere, profeſſing conſtantly this circumciſion without hands. A third ſort, partaking of the properties of both the former: for they agree with the beſt in theſe things: 1. In the loue of the miniſterie and Miniſters that preach faithfully. 2. In the taſte of the powers of the life to come, finding the word often of ſingular power, ſo as they receiue it with ioy and great admiration. 3. In the defence of the truth they ſeeme as forward as any: theſe are neere the kingdom of God, as the <hi>Scribe</hi> was; theſe are more then halfe perſwaded, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> was; theſe are fired with deſire many times to know what to doe to be ſaued, as the <hi>young man</hi> in the Goſpell was; but alas all this brings them within the compaſſe of none of Gods promiſes: and if they looke not to it, fearefull apoſtacie will be the end of all this, and they may proue moſt ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduerſaries of the ſame miniſterie they admired, and proud contemners of the ſame remorſe, with which themſelues were often ſmitten, and ſo their latter end be ten times worſe then their beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what doe theſe men want, or what are their defects, that they ſhould not be right for all this, hauing ſuch great affection to the word, yea euen when it is moſt ſincerely taught?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Alas there are diuers things too apparant in their eſtate. For firſt, they ioyne not themſelues with ſuch as feare God in fellowſhip in the Goſpel. 2. They ſhunne by all meanes the croſſe for righteouſneſſe ſake. 3. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4894:157"/> not all Gods commandements: there are ſome ſinnes they will not leaue: there are ſome corruptions they are ſo engaged vnto, that they will at no hand leaue them. 4. Some of them forſake not the very ſinnes they ſeem to deteſt and ſometimes to cry out againſt; they cry out vpon ſwearing, and yet (vile beaſts as they are) they will ſweare ſtill, yea and that moſt feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea after many remorſes of conſcience for it. 5. They will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vſe all Gods ordinances: indeed they heare conſtantly, and to any mans thinking, with great attention, but they pray not in their families, they will not vſe the helpe of conference, they read not the Scriptures with any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or conſcience, &amp;c. 6. You ſee they are not carefull of their companie, they neither ſhunne the appearance nor the occaſions of euill, they giue not ouer their going, nor their reſort vnto vngodly companie. They haue not beene truely humbled by godly ſorrow for their ſinne. Laſtly, they haue ſinceritie in reſpect of perſons; in ſome they like it, in others they doe not like it. They <hi>loue not all the Saints.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That, that is not circumciſion which is outward, made with the hands of man, but that is true circumciſion which is inward. Hence there is two ſorts of Iſraelites: the one is a carnall Iſralite, <hi>one outward;</hi> the other is a true Iſralite, for he is <hi>one inward in his ſpirit.</hi> As it was then ſo it is now, the carnall Iſralite hath the name of Iſraell, and the ſigne of true circumciſion; as then the circumciſion in the fleſh, ſo now baptiſme: and beſides they profeſſe to be the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they ſpeake faire of God and heauen. <hi>Q.</hi> But what are the principall defects of the carnall Iſralite?<note place="margin">The defects of the carnall Iſralite.</note> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Hee reſts in the worke done, he beares himſelfe vpon the externall worke of holines: he ſerued God, for he was at Church: he is regenerated, for he was baptiſed; he hath praied to God, for he ſtretched out his hands. 2. His praiſe is of men and not of God. 3. He wholly neglects the power of godlineſſe and the exerciſes thereof. 4. He is diſordered in his life laden with iniquitie. 5. He is ſenſeleſſe or incorrigible vnder publicke iudgements. 6. He vſually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and perſueth him that is <hi>borne after the ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may note here that God is not tied to meanes, hee can worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands. What is then the eſtate of wicked men? no hands of men or Angels can make them happie, it is a worke done without hands. Oh how honourable is the worke of mortification of a ſinner? it was a glorious worke to make thoſe huge heauens, and this mightie earth without hands: ſuch is the glorie of our ſpirituall circumciſion: we ſee alſo here how little beholding the kingdome of Chriſt is to this world: their hands will not be gotten to ſet it vp, God muſt doe it without hands. Laſtly wee ſhould learne in all eſtates to liue by faith and reſt vpon God, whether in affliction or tentation or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſinne, though we ſee not meanes, yet let this comfort vs God can helpe vs without hands.

                  </p>
                  <p>The fleſh is one of the three great enemies of God and mans ſaluation, it is a trecherous domeſticall enemie.

A moſt ſecret enemie for ſhe ſits at the fountaine and poiſoneth all: moſt falſly ſhe lets the Deuill, and permits him to ſet vp his holds and fortifications in the mindes of men: and is neuer quiet till it bring the ſoule into actuall high treaſon againg God. It is the fleſh that cauſeth whoredomes, murder, drunkeneſſe, and all diſorders. She oppoſeth all the waies of goodnes, both by obiecting againſt them, and by making <hi>euill preſent,</hi> ſhe <hi>ſauours not the things of God,</hi> nor <hi>can vnderſtand them.</hi> It is ſhee that makes the <hi>Law vnpoſſible to vs:</hi> what with her <hi>vaile of ignorance,</hi> and the <hi>ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hardneſſe</hi> ſhe diffuſeth vpon our hearts and ſpirits, ſhe makes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4894:158"/> of God to ſeeme <hi>almoſt</hi> alwaies <hi>euill</hi> vnto vs. Yea if ſhee get into her throne ſhe dare exalt herſelfe againſt God, and iudge euen God himſelfe, and his will, counſell, prouidence, and people; her very <hi>wiſedome is enmitie againſt God.</hi> And ſo infectiouſly vile is ſhe, that ſhe diffuſeth her poiſon to our very poſteritie, ſo as we beget a very race of rebels: and in all this, ſhe fortifies her ſelfe by all aduantages, from euill example, or by riches, and worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or carnall wiſedome, or ſucceſſe in ſinning, yea rather then ſhe will be ſubdued or much purſued, ſhe will entrench her ſelfe vnder the very colours of Chriſt, making her pretence of following him in words, that ſhe may the more ſecurely follow her owne luſts in deed. This ſhe doth, and thus ſpoiles the image of God in vs, and makes vs moſt filthy and lothſome, and ſo opens the doore of our ſoule vnto Sathan, that our hearts are made a very ſtie for vncleane ſpirits to dwell in, and thus ſhe will doe if ſhe be not mortified, till ſhe bring men to hell and eternall condemnation there.</p>

Laſtly, he hath ſhewed vs waies, what we muſt doe that we might tame and ſubdue the fleſh: as when he telleth vs, firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</note> that we muſt be ſober, that is, moderate in meate and drink, and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and apparell, and what elſe may hamper the fleſh. 2. That we muſt put no confidence in the fleſh. 3. That we muſt mortifie it, by confeſſion of ſinne, and godly ſorrow, with ſtrong cries calling vpon God for helpe againſt it. 4. That we muſt ſearch the records of Gods promiſes, and by faith lay hold vpon him. For till we can ſhew a better draught of happineſſe then the fleſh doth, we doe in vaine go about to charme it. 5. We muſt ſilence it: not ſuffer it to obiect; or excuſe, or extenuate, or denie.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto in generall of the fleſh and the mortification of it. Now more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we muſt conſider here, 1. the matter to be mortified, viz. the <hi>body of ſinnes.</hi> 2. The manner, in the words <hi>put off.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sinnes]</hi> Two things may be here noted; the one is implied, the other is expreſt: that which is implied is, that God doth not require this circumciſion in other things but only in ſinnes. 1. Regeneration doth not oppoſe the fleſh in the ſubſtance of it: we are not required to cut off any parts of the body, nor to deſtroy any faculties of the ſoule; and the ſame I ſay of the complexion or conſtitution of the body, it doth not require the melancholy man ſhould be made ſanguine. 2. This circumciſion reacheth not to the naturall deſires of the fleſh, I meane ſuch as are needfull to the being of nature, as to eate, ſleepe &amp;c. 3. Nor to the morrall proiects. 4. Nor to the remainders of ſpirituall light, as ſparkles of Gods Image. 5. Nor to the outward neceſſary helpes of life, as horſe, land, friends, &amp;c. onely it reſtraines thoſe when they are hinderances to godlineſſe. The vſe is therefore wiſely to diſcerne between the meere naturall defects ariſing from the conſtitution of our bodies, and the ſinnes and diſorders of our ſoules: for this ſpirituall circumciſion will not cure mens bodies, but only ſanctifies mens mindes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we ſhould learne of God here how to deale with our enemies: he

                  <p>The ſecond thing here to be noted, is, that our ſinnes are from the fleſh: yea if the fleſh did not by defect, action, approbation or conſent, giue way to ſinne, the Deuill and the world could faſten no ſinne vpon vs. Diuers perſons ſhould be informed herein: when they fall into grieuous euill, they cry out of their ill lucke, or of ill counſell, or ill company, or of the Deuill; but they ſhould indeed cry out of their owne ill nature, for the reſt could not haue hurt them, but by the wickedneſſe of their owne diſpoſition: and we ſhould all grow ſuſpitious of the fleſh and his motions, reaſons, deſires, &amp;c: and in time to mortifie her with all her luſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bodie of ſinnes]</hi> He ſaith not onely that there are ſinnes in the fleſh, but a body of ſinnes: that is, a huge maſſe or lumpe of ſinnes, linked together as the members of our bodie are. The ſins of the fleſhly may be called a body in diuers reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of that harmonie and vnion of ſinnes one with another in practiſe, ſo as if one ſinne be practiſed, many will accompanie it: as in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, the ſinne was to eat the forbidden fruit; but that would not be alone, but was attended with doubting of Gods word, with faith in the deuill, with moſt inordinate pride or deſire to be like God, with diſcontentment with their preſent condition, with vile ingratitude, with apoſtacie from all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, with prophanation of the ſacrament, with wilfull murther of all their poſteritie, and euill concupiſcence. <hi>Cain</hi> was angry that God did not accept his prophane ſacrifice: but would this ſinne be alone? no, for there followes it the hatred of his brother, the falling of his countenance, the reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Gods admonition, coloured hypocriſie, murther, and blaſphemie. When deſire of gaine infects the hearts of Trades-men, we ſee by experience, it will not be alone, a number of tranſgreſſions growes with it, as loue of the world more then God, neglect of ſinceritie in the vſe of Gods ordinances, ſwearing, breach of Sabboth, rigorous dealing with inferiours, vnmercifulnes to the poore, ſelling by falſe weights and meaſures, vſurie, if not otherwiſe yet in ſelling time, deceit, lying, oppreſſion by ingroſſing of wares or incroaching vpon the trades of others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of vnion in continuance after they are committed, thy ſinnes committed vaniſh not, but by adding ſinne vnto ſinne, thou makeſt vp a very body of ſinne, and ſo in Gods ſight they ſtand compacted together as the very limbes of a monſter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe ſinnes may be called a body, becauſe they are committed by the body, as the externall meanes of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The maſſe of ſinne in the fleſhly man may be called a body of ſinnes, for that it hath many things like vnto the body of man: or many compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be taken from the body of a man to expreſſe the ſinnes of the fleſh. As the body of man is a faire ſubſtance made of baſe matter: ſo ſinne in it ſelfe is moſt vile,<note place="margin">Similes.</note> though it be coloured ouer by the deuill or the world with the faire proportion of profit or pleaſure. And as there be many members in the body, ſo there are in the ſinne of the fleſhly man: as ſome members in the body are outward, ſome inward, ſo are our ſins. As men would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their bodies, were it not for their clothing, eſpecially if there be any deformitie: ſo would men of their ſinnes, were it not for their great places, or faire excuſes, and wretched ſhifts they haue to hide their deformities. And as the body of the priſoner in a dungeon is alike a true body, with his that ſitteth on the throne: ſo ſinnes that are ſecret, that are neuer ſo cloſely committed, are ſinnes, as well as ſuch as are openly done. As his body is a true body, that yet wants a legge or an arme: ſo it is in ſome, though they be not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4894:159"/> or adulterers, yet they may haue a bodie of ſinne in them. As the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie cannot liue, if you take away foode and clothing: ſo neither would ſinne, if we did not loue it, approue it, defend it, excuſe it, and if wee take away carnall reaſon, and ill companie. And as the bodie of Princes is better clad, then the bodies of poore men, yet it is alike, a bodie of clay and corruption: ſo are the ſinnes of great men, though men doe not ſpeake ſo openly of them.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note>Now for vſe of all. Firſt, here we may ſee a difference between the ſinnes of the regenerate, and the ſinnes of the vnregenerate: in the godly after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there is not a bodie of ſinnes, the neſt of ſinne is ſcattered, ſinne is not in his full ſtrength, he doth not <hi>giue his members as ſeruants to vnrighteouſnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, here men may try the truth of their repentance, that is not true repentance, that mortifies ſome one or few ſinnes, but that which mortifieth a whole bodie of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſhewes the greatnes of Gods mercies, that can forgiue or take away a whole body of ſinnes and tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this may be a great comfort to afflicted conſciences, that cry out of the multitude of their ſinnes: if thy ſinnes were as many as the ioynts of thy body, and as ſtrong as the body of <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet the Lord can forgiue, and true repentance will pull them downe. This is the matter to be mortified, the manner followes.</p>

                     <hi>Put off]</hi> Sinne muſt be put off as the begger puts off his raggs, and as the Maſter puts off his falſe ſeruant, and as the porter puts off his burden, and as the husband puts off his vitious wife, and as the ſerpent puts off his skin.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> But how can it then be ſaid to be put away? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sinne is put away, firſt if it <hi>reigne not,</hi> not hold a conſtant <hi>dominion</hi> ouer vs: it may be put away euen when it leads vs captiue, if it be an vnwilling captiuitie, if the power of it ſeeme vnto vs, as a moſt baſe ſeruitude.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sinne is put off fiue waies.</note>That this may yet be better vnderſtood, we muſt know that ſinne is put off fiue waies euen in this life. 1. <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> in the ſigne, couenant, and ſeale, that is in baptiſme. 2. <hi>In the guilt of it,</hi> though not in the act of it; thus God puts off, by not imputing. 3. <hi>In act too, by inchoation,</hi> though not perfectly. 4. <hi>Perfectly,</hi> though not in vs, yet <hi>in Chriſt</hi> our head it is already put away, in

                  <p>
                     <hi>By the circumciſion of Chriſt]</hi> There is a twofold circumciſion of Chriſt.<note place="margin">A twofold circumciſion of Chriſt.</note> Firſt, that which he ſuffered in himſelfe. Secondly, that which he works in vs; the vertue of the firſt is a great cauſe of the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why was Chriſt circumciſed,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> ſeeing there was no cauſe of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in Chriſt: for nothing could be ſignified by it, ſeeing he was the Meſſias himſelfe, perfect God and man, nor was there any impuritie in him, the amputation whereof ſhould thereby be ſignified, he was a Lambe without ſpot, a high Prieſt ſeparate from ſinners, the couenant of the promiſed ſeede was in him fulfilled, and he came to aboliſh circumciſion: and laſtly, tis he that circumciſeth the hearts of others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt was circumciſed, thereby to ſhew himſelfe to be true man. 2. Thereby to honour the inſtitution of circumciſion, as he had done other parts of the Law. 3. That the Iewes might not cauill, and ſay, they would not receiue an vncircumciſed Chriſt. 4. To commend the vertue of obedience by his example. 5. That he might beare the burthens of them, that being vnder the law, were not able to beare the burthens of the law: God by this ſigne as by an initiating rite, did ſubiect him to the law, he hereby profeſſing himſelfe a ſeruant to the Law to make vs free. 6. Hee was circumciſed and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſignifie his vnion with both Churches, both of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he came <hi>of twaine to make one.</hi> 7. To ratifie and ſanctifie the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the Fathers, as his baptiſme now ſanctifieth ours. 8. To ſignifie the cleanſing of our nature, eſpecially by bearing of the imputation of our impurities. 9. He did in his circumciſion begin to ſatisfie God, by thoſe firſt fruits of his bloud, it was as an earneſt or pledge of his bloud, to be more plentifully powred out: it was a part of his humiliation, and of the price of our ſinnes. Laſtly, he was circumciſed, that our hearts, by the vertue of it, might be circumciſed: for as his death killeth ſinne in vs, and his reſurrection raiſeth vs vp to newneſſe of life, ſo doth his circumciſion, circumciſe our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may gather comfort againſt the difficulties of mortification, for Chriſt will be pleaſed to deriue vertue from his owne circumciſion: yea it is a pledge to aſſure vs, that as certainly as he was circumciſed himſelfe, ſo he will ſee to it, that our hearts be circumciſed: if we will caſt our ſelues vpon him, and by faith come vnto him, there is no ſinne ſo linked, but in Chriſt we may haue ſome deliuerance from it. On the other ſide, it ſhewes the miſerie of all ſuch, as liue in the loue of their ſinnes, and minde not mortification: this ſhewes they are not in Chriſt yet, for they cannot be in Chriſt, except they be circumciſed. Laſtly, it may ſerue for inſtruction at once to all that hope for freedom in Ieſus Chriſt, to ſhew the proofe of their intereſt by their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſpiritually; and to ſpeake diſtinctly of it, we muſt vnderſtand that the Lord, that requires this circumciſion of vs, extends his precept, both to the heart<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. The ſinnes in the heart to be circumciſed. Sinnes in the eares to be circumciſed. Sinnes in the tongue to be circumciſed.</note>: in the heart we muſt eſpecially looke to the circumciſion, or mortification, 1. of ignorance. 2. of wicked thought. 3. immoderate care. 4. prophanenes in Gods ſeruice, in a wretched ſecuritie, or a neglect of inward worſhip. 5. diſordered affections, as luſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſuſpition. 6. diſcontent with our eſtate. 7. vnbeleefe. Now for our eares, they muſt be circumciſed, 1. in the vnpreparednes, or want of attention in hearing the word. 2. in receiuing tales. 3. incommunicating with the ſinnes of others, by a willing hearing of their wickedneſſe. Laſtly, looke to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the tongue, and that in the care to auoide, 1. the polluting of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4894:160"/> Gods name, either by ſwearing or blaſphemie. 2. raſh cenſuring. 3. rotten ſpeech. 4. lying. 5. bitter and furious words, and the ſpirit of contradiction. 6. flattery. 7. tale-bearing. 8. idle and vaine words.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Buried together with him]</hi> Three things may be here noted: 1. the buriall of Chriſt. 2. the buriall of the Chriſtian. 3. the vnion of both. For the firſt, that Chriſt was buried, was ſtoried by the Euangeliſt<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.</note>, and fore-ſignified by <hi>Ionas</hi> as a type<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39, 40</note>, and fore-prophecied of by <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.9.</note>: he was buried in Ieruſalem, the place where the dying ſacrifices had giuen warning of his death, but it was without the Citie, both to anſwer the type, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. and to ſignifie that his ſufferings belonged to Gentiles, as well as to Iewes: He was buried in Caluarie, the place commonly appointed for condemned men (and not in Hebron, where ſome thinke <hi>Adam</hi> was buried) to note that his death was to be auaileable for the condemned men of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as for <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe. He was buried in another mans graue, to ſignifie that he died for other mens ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond, viz. the buriall of Chriſtians; they may be ſaid to be buried euen whiles they liue (for the buriall of the body he cannot meane here) in diuers reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of diſgrace and reproch: the throats of wicked men are often <hi>an open ſepulchre</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.</note>, into which if the names of the godly fall, they are buried for the extremitie of diſgrace and reproch with which they couer them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of <hi>abnegation,</hi> or the deniall of the loue and care for earthly things: and ſo we are buried to the world, when like dead men we care not for it, but deuote our ſelues to the contemplation of heauenly things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of <hi>mortification</hi> of our ſinnes: the ſcripture by diuers meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors expreſſeth the diuers degrees of mortification. For firſt there is the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4894:160"/> wounding of ſinne, when the ſinner is pricked with remorſe by the law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the condemning of ſinne, when the ſinner keeping a ſpirituall aſſiſe, doth examine, confeſſe, and iudge himſelfe guilty before the Lord. Thirdly, the crucifying of ſinnes, when the ſinner racks his owne ſoule by godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, driuing in the nailes of Gods threatnings, with acknowledgment of his owne deſerts, and reſtraining his fleſh through a ſpirituall reuenge, not caring to expoſe himſelfe to the ſhame of the world, ſo that in Chriſt he may finde atonement for his ſinnes. Fourthly, the killing of ſinne, when the ſinner puts off the bodie of ſinnes, and forſaketh his euill waies. Now then after this followeth the laſt degree, and that is here the <hi>buriall of ſinnes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the buriall of ſinne.</note> Certainely there remaines euen after true repentance in the very godly, a great deale of hidden corruption of nature, inward wandrings, &amp; diſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s after the world, ſudden euill propoſitions againſt God, or his word, or prouidence, or preſence, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or people, impatience, ſecret pride, and ſomtimes hypocriſie; a frequent rebellion within againſt good duties, vnthankfulnes, frequent omiſſions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of holy duties, or the care of the power of them, haſtines, or anger, impure deſires, thoughts of reuenge, beſides a great deale of diſorder, he may finde in himſelfe both at home and abroad. Now it is not enough, nor may he reſt in the former repentance, but he muſt proceed euen to the remouing of theſe remainders of corruption: death commonly ariſeth out of the diſeaſe of ſome one part, but buriall couers all. The worke of reformation and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, many times begins at the care of ſome few principall ſinnes: but we muſt neuer be quiet, till we burie the whole old man with his works; ſo that in one ſenſe, the buriall of ſinnes, is nothing elſe, but the progreſfe of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Againe, after we haue forſaken our ſinnes, to burie them, is to keep a diligent watch ouer our nature, and to take downe our fleſh, yea ſometimes with refraining of lawfull delights or pleaſures. Further the buriall of ſinne, it may import our care, after we haue left our ſinnes, to remoue them out of ſight; both out of Gods ſight, by ſuing out our pardon, and out of the ſight of our conſciences, by quieting them in the application of the bloud of Chriſt, and the promiſes of grace, and out of the ſight of others (ſo farre as our ſinnes were ſcandalous alſo) by ſhewing forth our repentance, and care to auoide all appearance and occaſions of like ſinning.<note place="margin">Their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that haue attained to the buriall of ſinne.</note> Great is the glory and happineſſe of Chriſtians, that haue attained to this buriall of ſinne, for theſe ſerue God in a neere acquaintance with him, theſe haue <hi>ouercome the world,</hi> theſe can <hi>ſtand</hi> before <hi>death</hi> and <hi>iudgement</hi> vnapalled, theſe are mighty in the <hi>power</hi> of Gods ordinance, theſe know <hi>the ſecrets of the kingdome of God,</hi> theſe are without the reach of the <hi>Law,</hi> and feele not the ſting of croſſes, theſe are had in ſingular honour with God, and the holy Angels of heauen, and the prouidence of God is vſually eminent towards theſe. Now for the third, might ſome one ſay, what hath the Chriſtians buriall to doe with Chriſt,<note place="margin">How our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall buriall depends vpon Chriſt.</note> how is there any relation betweene them? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our ſpirituall buriall in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of mortification depends vpon Chriſt diuers waies. 1. In that he hath required and made gracious promiſes to it. 2. In that the efficacie of the meanes by which it is wrought, comes from Chriſt. 3. In that it is accepted of God onely for Chriſt and through his interceſſion. 4. In reſpect of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was buried as well as we. But chiefly in reſpect of vertue, our buriall of ſinne is wrought by a vertue ariſing from Chriſts buriall in the graue.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes of all this followes. Firſt for information; here we may ſee how God ſtands vpon mortification:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> The ſtate of ſuch as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> and that men muſt not thinke alwaies they haue done inough, when they haue left their faults; and withall we may ſee how dangerous a courſe they take, that ſo ſoone giue ouer the exerciſes of mortification: for by this meanes we cauſe the old ſinnes many times to breake out againe, and their conſolations are ſmall, and ſeldom; croſſes daily
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4894:161"/> trouble them, and the heart is often grieued and griped with feare and terrible doubts, or elſe they are quickly ouergrowne with a ſpirit of ſlumber.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for inſtruction, to be carefull to burie our ſinnes: but here take heede of the diſſimilitude,<note place="margin">Diſſimilitude in tvvo things.</note> for in ſome things the compariſon cannot hold: as here in two things; for firſt when we burie the bodies of our friends, we burie them in hope they ſhal riſe againe. And ſecondly, we mourne becauſe we muſt part with them: but both theſe muſt be denied here. It is the propertie of the wicked, to part with their ſinnes with ſorrow, becauſe they muſt leaue them: or elſe with hope that at length they may returne to them againe.<note place="margin">Note this rule</note> But let all ſuch as feare God be otherwiſe minded: eſpecially let vs learne from this compariſon of buriall to aduantage our ſelues in what we may in mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Similitudes.</note> if the maſter be buried, we know all his ſeruants will attend the funerall: ſo is it with vs in the mortification of ſinnes, if we light vpon the maſter ſins and drag them to the graue, we ſhall be ſure of all the attendants, they will follow to the funerall. The Iewes manner was to burie with odours: ſo ſhould we, our odours and ſweet ſmelling prayers offered vp in the mediation of Chriſt. And howſoeuer this worke may ſeeme difficult, yet God many times ſtrangely relieues our infirmities. After <hi>Iezabel</hi> was caſt downe and dead, they had not been long within, but ſending out to burie her, they found nothing but the skull and her feet, and the palmes of her hands: ſo many times would it be with vs, if we caſt downe the <hi>Iezabels</hi> our ſinnes, when we come to finiſh our mortification, we may by the ſtrange helpe of God finde the bodie of the maſter gone we know not how, ſo as we ſhall not be troubled, vnleſſe it be with ſome skull or feete, or palme of ſinne. But certainely though this kinde of buriall be ſomewhat difficult, yet it is the true buriall place of Kings: the moſt noble funerall that can be.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt effect. The ſecond is in the next words.</p>

The ſecond is the lifting of men vp to ſome ſpeciall callings in the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. The third is the reſurrection of our bodies at the laſt day.

                  <p>We muſt know that there are diuers duties which the naturall man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be brought vnto, in which lieth the very power of godlineſſe, and the experience of all ſound and ſauing conſolation. Now theſe duties may be three waies conſidered. 1. As they reſpect holy life in generall. 2. As they reſpect piety to God. 3. As they reſpect righteouſneſſe to men. For the firſt, there are foure things wherein the liues of Gods children differ from all others. 1. In the manner. 2. In the matter. 3. In the meanes. 4. In the ends of holy life. For the manner, three things are eminent. 1. That they are deuoted and conſecrated to holines<note n="l" place="margin">

                  <p>Now in reſpect of piety to God, it is a very reſurrection through the power of Chriſt, to bring a man to acknowledge God, and his truth, and glory, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon, profit, or pleaſure: to make a man <hi>walke with God, ſetting the Lord alwaies before him:</hi> to bring the will of man to a holy ſubiection to Gods will, in croſſes, temptations, wants, &amp;c: but eſpecially to <hi>create</hi> in man that ſinceritie of <hi>worſhipping God in ſpirit and truth</hi> without hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>And as for righteouſneſſe, in that part of it, that concernes either mens owne ſoules, or the ſoules of others, how is all the vnregenerate mankinde dead? It is the worke of a godly man only <hi>to ſerue the brethren by loue:</hi> onely the members of Chriſt, can in their calling denie profit and pleaſure, and make the particular calling ſerue the generall: but eſpecially in the combat againſt concupiſcence, onely the godly doe make conſcience of it.</p>
                  <p>And howſoeuer in the matter of holy duties, there are ſtrange imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the very godly, yet their deſire, prayer, purpoſe, and indeuour, is to approue themſelues to God herein, and they do attaine to it, in ſome comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beginnings, and they go on with a holy increaſe, both of ſtrength and deſire. Whereas it is euident by diuers Scriptures, that wicked men are dead men in the former reſpects, as would appeare if we ſhould examine particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for they <hi>ſeeke not God</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note>The vſes may be diuers. Firſt for information; we may here ſee how vaine the common faith of the common Proteſtant is: ſhew me thy faith by thy fruits; how canſt thou beleeue aright, and yet thy ſinnes not mortified, and thy heart and life vnſanctified? Againe, we ſee we haue not comfort of our baptiſme, till the power of holineſſe in ſome meaſure appeare in our liues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for inſtruction: we ſhould all examine our ſelues whether we haue faith or no; and whiles we haue meanes of aſſurance, make vſe of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages to ſettle our hearts in the faith: and to this end we ſhould deliuer vp our ſoules to be nurſed vp in the words of faith and wholeſome doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we might here be greatly comforted, if we had true faith: we ſee God can denie nothing vnto faith: it ſhould be to vs, in the ſacraments, in mortification,<note place="margin">Three rules if vve vvould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Gods povver to the effect.</note> and in graces and duties, according to our faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the operation of God]</hi> The doctrine of Gods power and working, is of ſingular vſe in the Church; great is the intereſt of Gods ſeruants in his power, and therefore great cauſe they haue to reſt vpon it. The elect onely can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Gods power to the effect: he is able to doe it, therefore he will do it: but then theſe three things muſt be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They muſt be beleeuers, that looke for this priuiledge. 2. They muſt bring a particular faith, to draw out this power of God into operation. 3. It will not be ſet a worke about euery thing, but ſuch things for which there is promiſe or meete examples in the ſcriptures.</p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">In vvhat things vvee may beare our ſelues vpon Gods povver.</note>Now it is a matter of ſingular weight, to know in what things we may haue warrant to beare our ſelues vpon the power of God. The power of God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for operation in foure things for the benefit of the faithfull. Firſt, in their afflictions. Secondly, in their temptations. Thirdly, in the difficulties of holy life. Fourthly, in his ordinances.</p>
                  <p>In afflictions, God hath bound himſelfe to ſhew his power, 1. In giuing ſtrength to endure them<note n="c" place="margin">

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20. <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.</note>. If we looke vpon the enemies of the godly in particular, God ſhewes his power, 1. In reſtraining or diſappointing them<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 12.16. <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.16, 17.</note>. 2. In rewarding and ouerthrowing them<note n="h" place="margin">

                  <p>So likewiſe in temptations, the power of God though it be ſecret, yet it is wonderfull in diſſoluing the works of the deuill, and in vpholding his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and deſtroying the ſtrong holds, and fortifications of Satan<note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the difficulties of holy life, the Lord vſeth his power, 1. In making his ſeruants able to walke in his waies, both by giuing them power and ſtrength<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eze</hi> 36.28. <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.12.</note>, and by relieuing and reuiuing their ſtrength daily, and renewing it<note n="l" place="margin">

                  <p>Laſtly, Gods operation is wonderfull in the vſe of his ordinances; and this is that is meant in this place. In reſpect of this the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>God is greatly to be reuerenced in the aſſembly, by all them that are round about him: O Lord God of hoſtes, who is a ſtrong God like vnto thee</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4894:163"/> it is in particular in the ſacraments: though for their outward ſhew they doe not promiſe much, yet by the maruellous operation of God, they are auailea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in effect for all that is promiſed in them, onely if we could get this faith in this operation of God here mentioned.</p>

                  <p>THe ſixt reaſon of the dehortation is conteined in this verſe, and it ſtands thus: That which cannot helpe vs when we are in miſerie, nor further vs to happines when we want it, is not to be followed nor reſted vpon; but ſuch things are philoſophy, traditions, and ceremonies, they cannot heale the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our natures, nor raiſe vs out of the graues of ſinne, nor any way procure vs the pardon of our tranſgreſſions: or thus, If in Chriſt we be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the power of our ſinnes by his quickning grace, and from the guilt of them, by the free pardon which is to be had by his meanes, then we need not goe any whither elſe, neither to philoſophie nor traditions, &amp;c. but ſo it is, and ſo the very Coloſſians found it in their caſe, as the words of the text expreſſe, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words in themſelues expreſſe the twofold eſtate of Chriſtians in this world, what they are by nature in their vnregenerate eſtate, and what they are by grace in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtate of corruption two things are true of them, and are true of all men. 1. They were dead in actuall ſinnes. 2. They were then in the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh, and likewiſe dead in it. In their eſtate of grace he puts them in minde of two benefits, 1. Regeneration. 2. Remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the coherence and order of the words.</p>
                  <p>Diuers things may be noted in the generall.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may from hence be informed of the fruitleſnes of philoſophie, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they cannot make a miſerable man happy, they cannot infuſe the leaſt ſparke of ſpirituall life into any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee the Apoſtle thinks it meet to put men often in minde of their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4894:164"/> miſerie by nature, and great reaſon, for it exalts the praiſe of the <hi>riches of Gods grace in Chriſt:</hi> And it may ſerue to humble men for their falls after calling, and to keep them ſtill ſuſpitious and watchfull ouer a nature, that hath been ſo prone to ſinne and ſecuritie in ſinning; it may ſerue to eat down the prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our nature to vaine boaſting, &amp; confidence in the fleſh; and it ſhould much excite men to the loue and care of godlineſſe and pietie, with all life and power, ſeeing they haue been ſo long ſlaues to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, the Apoſtle rips vp this matter of purpoſe to withdraw their mindes from traditions, and philoſophicall dreames.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dead in ſinnes]</hi> They were dead in ſinnes, both if you reſpected their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like eſtate, or each particular perſon. If you looke vpon publike ſtates before they are framed and reformed by the word, what are they but heaps of men dead in the graues of ſinne, and ſenſeleſſe in their ſinfull courſes? and thus it is with euery particular perſon, the words import that he is guilty of many ſinnes,<note place="margin">The ſvvarmes of ſinnes in vnregenerate men.</note> and he is dead in them alſo. Naturally euery man is guilty of ſecret atheiſticall conceits, of vnbeleefe, of ignorance, of hardnes of heart, of ſwarms of euill thoughts and affections, of hurtfull paſſions and luſts, beſides his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the knowledge of God, and that warmth of the holy affections of loue, feare, truſt, and ioy in God.

Oh the world of ſinnes we are actually guilty of againſt God, or men, or our owne ſelues, publike, priuate, ſecret, open, inward, outward, in proſperitie and aduerſitie, in the Church or familie, or abroad in mens conuerſation.

                     <note place="margin">Death to ſin, for ſinne, and in ſinne.</note>The Coloſſians were dead ſpiritually: there is a <hi>death to ſinne,</hi> and a <hi>death for ſinne,</hi> and a <hi>death in ſinne:</hi> a <hi>death to ſinne,</hi> and ſo the godly die by mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: a <hi>death for ſinne,</hi> and ſo malefactors die by execution: and a <hi>death in ſinne,</hi> and ſo euery naturall man kills himſelfe by enliuing his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What ſpiritual death in ſin is.</note>The ſpirituall death in ſinne is an vnutterable loſſe of the life of God, by which the ſinner is ſenſeleſſe, and careleſſe in extremitie of miſery, vnto his owne euerlaſting ruine, if the Lord preuent it not by regeneration. Now that men are in this caſe by nature, theſe Scriptures proue, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Math.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.32. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Iud.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. Neither let any deceiue themſelues, about their eſtate, for a man may be dead in ſinne, and yet be aliue in the fleſh: yea thou maieſt be a <hi>wiſe man</hi> in the fleſh<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</note>, or <hi>a prince of this world</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 9.14.</note>; yea thou maieſt haue <hi>a name that thou liueſt</hi> ſpiritually<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.2.</note>, and yet be ſtarke dead.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſpirituall ſenſeleſnes is called a death, becauſe it is a priuation of ſpirituall life from the ſoule, as the naturall death is from the body. 2. becauſe it tends to eternall death.</p>
                  <p>The vſe may be fourefold. 1. For information: No wonder wicked men can come and goe from the word of God, and not be touched, alas they are dead men: and ſo is it with them in reſpect of the iudgements of God; alas if thou couldeſt rowle a mountaine vpon a dead man, he would not feele, ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4894:164"/> is it with a man dead in ſinne; and further we may heere obſerue, that to liue yea to die quietly, is no ſigne of a man in a happy caſe: for if this death in ſin be not cured, thouſands of people may die quietly, becauſe they die ſenſeleſly; they feele no more of the feare of hell, or iudgement, or Gods anger, then if they were already dead in their bodies, they would feele outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities: I know that God many times can lay terror vpon the fleſh of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and make their ſpirits drinke in, of the bitter anguiſh ariſing from the feruencie of Gods burning diſpleaſure; but I ſay if God let them alone, vſually the moſt would die in a wretched ſenſeleſnes, and inconſideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither able nor willing to entertaine the thoughts of what muſt preſently and neceſſarily befall them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may ſerue for confutation; and ſo 1. of the Papiſts about their freewill. How can there be this free will in a dead ſoule? we are dead in ſinne, and therefore of our ſelues mooue not vnto life, till God quicken vs by his word and ſpirit. 2. Of the carnall Proteſtant, that beares himſelfe ſo ſtrongly vpon his ſuppoſed <hi>couenant with death and hell,</hi> his <hi>agreement muſt be diſanulled,</hi> nay his very ſecuritie imports his vnauoidable deſtruction, if it be not remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the power of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For inſtruction; art thou a man that heareſt this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that haſt liued all thy time without remorſe for thy ſinnes, and neuer yet entertained the care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of thy life, be heere warned of thy miſerie, let it bee enough thou haſt been dead in ſinne, doe not lie ſtill rotting in the graues of iniquitie, but riſe ſo ſoone as thou heareſt the trumpet of the Goſpell, the voice of Chriſt ſounding in thine eares, and piercing thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, here is conſolation implied vnto weake Chriſtians; If thou canſt feele thy miſerie, and ſtruggle in any meaſure, of true conſtancie, againſt the corruption of nature, and the tranſgreſſions of thy heart and life, thou art not dead: there is ſome breath of life in thee, there is motion and therefore life.</p>
                  <p>Thus of their actuall ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Their miſerie in reſpect of originall ſinne, is expreſt in theſe words,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the vncircumciſion of the fleſh.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words be diuerſly interpreted; ſome thus, In the vncircumciſion of the fleſh, that is, in the fleſh which is vncircumciſion, that is a thing hatefull vnto God. Some make theſe words to bee the ſigne of their death in ſinne: as if hee would ſay, your very vncircumciſion that is in your fleſh (which are Gentiles) is a token that you are ſtrangers from the life of God. Some thus; And you hath hee quickned, which were dead in reſpect of your ſinnes and carnall life, which ye liue in the vncircumciſion, that is, in your eſtate of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſme. Some make theſe words expreſſe the cauſe of their death in ſinne: Thus in the vncircumciſion of the fleſh, that is, for your fleſhly vices which cauſed that death in ſinne. But I thinke with thoſe that vnderſtand by the fleſh originall ſinne, and by the vncircumciſion, their miſerie in reſpect of it, implied in the alluſion to the circumciſion literally taken.</p>
                  <p>Originall ſinne is called fleſh,<note place="margin">Why original ſinne is called fleſh.</note> becauſe the fleſh is the inſtrument by which it is propagated. 2. Becauſe it is the ſubiect in which it is. 3. Becauſe it is the end it driues vs to, viz. to ſatisfie the fleſh and to ſeeke fleſhly things.</p>
                  <p>This originall ſinne heere called fleſh, is a ſpirituall kinde of diſeaſe, gall,<note place="margin">What origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is.</note> leauen and poyſon, which daily diffuſeth it ſelfe throughout the whole man, and ſtill infecteth it: though this bee not the whole nature of the ſinne; for to ſpeake diſtinctly, in originall ſinne there are three things. 1.<note place="margin">3. Things in originall ſin.</note> The guiltineſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> fact, deriued vnto vs by iuſt imputation. 2. The want of that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall iuſtice was in vs in the creation. 3. The deprauation and corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our natures.<note place="margin">Our miſery in reſpect of originall ſin.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the word vncircumciſion imports our miſerie in reſpect of our very
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4894:165"/> corruption of nature, for it imports 1. That we are hatefull to God, children of wrath. 2. That we haue no portion in the heauenly Canaan. 3. That wee haue no fellowſhip in the communion of Saints. 4. That wee haue no part in the promiſed Meſſias, for all theſe were ſhadowed out by the want of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the time of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note>The vſes follow; Firſt, from hence wee may enforme our ſelues in diuers things; as firſt we may ſee, why the faire works of wicked men, as their almes, prayers, teares, ſacrifices, prophecyings, preaching, faſting, and profeſſing, are not accepted of God: for the fountaine is poyſoned, the fleſh infects all; it puts to, either ill ends, or ill effects, or ill meanes, beſides that, it keeps the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtill loathſome to God. Oh what cauſe haue ciuill honeſt men to know, that though they come to Church, and pay euery man his owne, and bee no drunkards nor adulterers &amp;c. yet their caſe cannot be good, for though they liued neuer ſo honeſtly outwardly, yet the very vncircumciſion of the fleſh, makes them miſerable; the inward corruption of nature is an abomination to God, who <hi>ſearcheth the heart and reines:</hi> yea, what cauſe haue all men to be humbled and abaſed in themſelues, conſidering how vncleane a beginning they haue? how can men bee ſo quiet, and yet be ſo diſeaſed, with ſo filthy a leproſie, as is originall ſinne? if this diſeaſe were in the body as it is in the ſoule, how would men lament their diſtreſſe?</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo may we ſee what a wofull eſtate all wicked men are in, that take <hi>care for the lusts</hi> of this leprous <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſow to it.</hi> What ſhould I ſay? may we not ſee hence the neceſſitie of regeneration? aſſuredly <hi>except wee be borne againe, we can neuer enter into the kingdome of heauen:</hi> this impure poyſoned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ours, may not enter into Gods holy place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may here diſcerne the fountaine of all actuall tranſgreſſions: when we fall into euill courſes, wee muſt not cry out of our ill fortune, or of ill company, or of the Deuill only, but eſpecially we muſt lay the fault vpon our ill natures, twas thy wicked diſpoſition made thee ſo to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, from hence we may learne to know our ſelues, and accordingly to keep a narrow watch ouer our wretched natures, and daily ſtriue and ſtruggle againſt this infectious corruption and diſeaſe that hangs ſo faſt vpon vs<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</note>: yea, we ſhould by confeſſion and contrition endeuour the daily <hi>crucifying</hi> of our wicked <hi>fleſh,</hi> with the <hi>luſts thereof</hi>

                  <p>But for the matter it ſelfe, we may here note.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God doth certainly forgiue men their ſinnes, when he giues them repentance, and conuerts them by his word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That where God forgiues our ſinnes, he heales our natures too, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quickning and forgiuing are here ioyned together; and herein Gods pardons differs from all the pardons of Kings. Men may forgiue the treaſon or fellony, but they cannot giue a nature that will offend no more, but now if God forgiue a man, he will certainely giue his good ſpirit to mend his nature, and cleanſe him from his ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That howſoeuer iuſtification go before ſanctification, yet it is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation firſt appeares, therefore quickning firſt named.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That it is a ſingular happineſſe to obtaine of God the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That if we were vſed according to our deſerts, God muſt neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs, it is his free grace.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of all may be firſt for great reproofe of the generall careleſſenes of the moſt men, that will take no paines at all to get the pardon of their ſinnes, but wholly neglect the ſeeking of the aſſurance of it. Now this monſtrous neglect of ſo admirable a benefit comes firſt from ignorance: men know not their wofull miſerie in reſpect of their ſinnes. 2. From the hardnes of mans heart, and their hearts in this point of neglect of remiſſion of ſinnes are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened both by the effectuall working of Satan, and by the example of the careleſſe multitude, and by the entertainement of falſe opinions about it, as that it need not be ſought, or cannot be knowne, or hereafter will be time inough to inquire: or elſe men are conceited in falſe acquitances; either they reſt in this, that Chriſt died for them, or that God makes promiſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe in Scripture, or that their ciuill courſe of life, or their works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or piety, will make God amends &amp;c. Againe, this neglect ariſeth from the forgetfulneſſe of mans latter end, if men knew the time of the day of the Lord, they would get their pardon confirmed if it were poſſible, leaſt it ſhould come vpon them vnawares. Laſtly, this comes from the loue of ſinne, men are loath to leaue their ſinnes, and therefore not carefull to ſeeke forgiueneſſe of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is a confutation of merit of workes, for if we pay the debt, then it is not forgiuen vs; and if it be forgiuen vs, then certainely we pay it not: be ſides the word notes that it is freely done, as hath been ſhewed before.</p>

                  <p>THis verſe and the next containe the ſeuenth reaſon of the dehortation, it is laid down in this verſe and amplified in the next. The argument may ſtand thus: If the ceremonies were a <hi>Chyrographe</hi> or hand-writing againſt vs, when they were in force, and if now Chriſt haue cancelled that writing, then we ought not to vſe them againe; but ſuch they were, for they were a hand-writing againſt vs, and Chriſt hath remoued them by faſtening them vpon the croſſe, therefore we ought not to reuiue them againe: or thus, if the debt be paid and the obligation cancelled, then is it a fond courſe to cauſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation wilfully to be of force againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hand-writing]</hi> This hand-writing is by diuers diuerſly referred, for ſome thinke it is to be referred to the couenant with <hi>Adam;</hi> all mankinde in him was bound to God, this obligation he brake and ſo the forfeiture, lay ſtill vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our neckes till Chriſt paid the debt, and cancelled the obligation. Some referre it to the law of Moſes in generall, and ſay the people did binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto it, Exod. 14. by the rites there vſed. This bond was forfeited by the Iewes and lay vpon them. Some referre it to the morrall law in ſpeciall, and therein we did enter into bond which was called the couenant of works: the rigor and curſe of this law lieth vpon all mankinde, and when God ſues out this bond men are carried to priſon, euen to the priſon of hell. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to the conſcience of men, and ſay that an euill conſcience is a <hi>Chyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe,</hi> a bill of debt, and it accuſeth by ordinances, that is, it taketh conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the law of God to arreſt, or condemne the ſinner. But moſt vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is referred to the ceremoniall law, by ſome of them men did enter into bond, as by circumciſion, ſo faith the Apoſtle, he <hi>that is circumciſed is bound to keepe the whole law,</hi> Gal. 5.5. By others of them men made bils of debt, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion confeſſeth corruption of nature by propagation. The waſhings were open confeſſions of the foulenes of our liues <hi rend="sup">x</hi>; in the ſacrifices men ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to their owne death and damnation: for they confeſſed they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to die in ſteed of the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>The words may be true of all, but moſt principally of the ceremoniall law In generall he here intreateth of deliuerance from the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then, two things may in particular be noted, 1. What the ceremonies were in themſelues. 2. The manner or meanes how the Church was diſcharged of them. For the firſt, if we require what they were? They were 1. for honor, <hi>ordinances</hi> of God. 2. for vſe, <hi>hand-writings.</hi> 3. for effect they were <hi>againſt vs,</hi> or contrarie to vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordinances]</hi> Some read <hi>for ordinances,</hi> ſome read <hi>by ordinances,</hi> ſome <hi>with ordinances,</hi> and ſome <hi>of ordinances.</hi> They that read <hi>for ordinances,</hi> ſay the hand-writing was for ordinances, that is, either in fauor of the decrees that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4894:167"/> vs, or for the better aſſuring of the keeping of the ordinances; it was <hi>by ordinances</hi> viz euangelicall, for they ſay the decrees of Chriſt did euacuate the lawes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They that read <hi>with ordinances,</hi> ſay that the hand-writing was the debt of death which Chriſt tooke away with the ordinance; that is the externall rites and rudiments of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But I thinke the ſenſe is cleare as it is here rendred <hi>of ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo the point to be obſerued is, that the ceremonies impoſed vpon the Iewes were Gods ordinances, which may ſhew vs that God did take vpon him the right to binde the conſcience, of men, by ceremonies. 2. Seeing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are freed from them by God himſelfe, therefore the Apoſtle would haue them ſtand to their libertie. 3. This ſhould exalt the praiſe of the morrall law; if they were bound to obſerue the very ceremonies becauſe they were Gods ordinances, then much more ſhould wee bee carefull to keepe the morrall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hand-writings]</hi> This word notes their vſe, becauſe men are by nature wonderfull ſlow to acknowledge their miſery, therefore the Lord in all ages did driue men vnder their hands as it were openly to make profeſſion of their owne ſin guiltineſſe and fall, that ſo Gods iuſtice might be cleared: Therfore were the ſacrifices required preſently after the fall; and baptiſme now is of like nature to ſhew vs our naturall vncleanneſſe, that need to be waſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Againſt vs]</hi> In effect they were againſt vs. The ceremonies were againſt vs, that is againſt the Iewes 4. waieas, 1. As they were bills of debt. 2. As they told the longing wife that her husband was long after to come. 3. As they proclaimed God infinitely hating ſinne, ſo as he muſt haue attonement in bloud and that daily. 4. As they were tranſgreſſed in reſpect of the right manner of obſeruing them.</p>
                  <p>Now though theſe ceremonies belong not to vs Chriſtians, yet we are in the ſame debt by nature, that they were, though wee haue not that way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our debt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how could that which God commanded them to do be againſt them? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many waies, 1. When they failed in the matter, as when they offered ſtrange fire or ſacrificed their ſonnes. 2 When they did anger God by omiſſions, or delaies, as when <hi>Moſes</hi> triſled out the circumciſion of his ſonne. 3. When they did it for wrong ends, as when the whore would ſacrifice to colour her whoredomes, Pro. 5. or when men did thinke thereby to make amends for their ſinnes, Ier. 7. or when they vſed them for the hurt of Gods children, as <hi>Balaam</hi> vſed his ſacrifice. 4. When they mingle their owne inuentions with Gods ordinances; and their feare towards God was taught by the precepts of men. 5. When they did vſe them, as a burthen, and it was a wearineſſe to them. Laſtly, when they that vſed them were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and did vſe them without knowledge, or faith, or repentance for their ſinnes, or the care of the due manner, as many places of Scripture ſhew. And thus may the very law of God be againſt vs ſtill, aſwell as againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of all this chiefly may be to ſhew, the miſery of euery impenitent ſinner, his ſinnes are vpon record, there is the hand-writing againſt him, let him looke vpon ſacrificing Iewes, &amp; there he may behold man daily in effect ſaying thus. Thus muſt it be done to the man that repenteth not of his ſins, the obligation lies forfeited, and the Lord may call vpon him for his debt of 10000. talents when he hath not a farthing to pay, and then he will be caſt into priſon.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4894:168"/> ceremonies were in themſelues. Now of the diſcharge from them, there two things may be noted, 1. The manner, <hi>Chriſt put them out, tooke them away, faſtned them.</hi> 2. The meanes, viz. <hi>the Croſſe.</hi> The ſumme is, that Chriſt Ieſus by his ſufferings on the Croſſe, paid our debt, and freed vs from the hand-writing that was againſt vs; the anger of God conceiued againſt vs, for the forfeiture, was thereon by the bloud of Chriſt appeaſed<note n="a" place="margin">

                        <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18.</note>; and if we would bee aſſured of our releaſe, in particular, Firſt, for the forfeiture in Paradice, we receiue an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the bloud of Chriſt<note n="e" place="margin">

                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15.</note>. And for the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we are by Chriſt deliuered both from the rigor of it, and from the curſe of it, his owne ſacrifice being the propitiatorie, to ſtill the crie of the Law, and to hide it from the eyes of Gods iuſtice <hi rend="sup">h</hi>; and as for the writing of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth it from dead workes<note n="i" place="margin">

For information; wee may ſee what a caſe ſinne ſets vs in by nature, and how hatefull the nature of ſinne is: if wee haue any thing to doe with God, why our ſinnes lie like ſo many blocks in our way, and Chriſt Ieſus only can lift them out of the way; and can our wretched hearts delight in ſinne, ſeeing they nailed Chriſt to the Croſſe? It is an eaſie thing to rent an obligation amongſt men, but it was not ſo eaſie, to get ours cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it could be rent in no place, but on the Croſſe, Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe muſt be faſtned to the tree, that he might faſten our cancelled hand-writing therto: and if God ſpared not his owne Sonne, when hee came about this buſineſſe of cancelling the hand-writing, what thinke we ſhall be the caſe of all wicked men, that die in their ſinnes, and muſt ſuffer the whole forfeiture to fall on their neckes? if what Chriſt endured on the Croſſe were ſo painefull, they muſt not thinke to eſcape. Hence alſo we may ſee what wonderfull cauſe wee haue to loue the Lord Ieſus, that hath done all this for vs, Oh how precious ſhould his memorie be amongſt vs? Finally, here the faithfull ſhould gather ſingular comfort againſt the law, ſinne, death and hell, ſeeing here they may be informed all theſe were nailed vpon the croſſe, and Chriſt hath openly declared that he hath cancelled whatſoeuer might be to ſhew againſt vs, for any forfeiture or debt of ours whatſoeuer; And ſhall not wee take heede of running in debt againe, by ſinning, after the ſprinkling of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt? or ſhall wee wretchedly binde our ſelues to the law againe, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our iuſtification before God by the workes of the law?</p>

                  <p>THeſe words are an amplification of the former, wherin he ſheweth that not only the Bill in which we were made infinitely indebted, was cancelled; but the deuills alſo (who had power to ſerue executions vpon vs, and proofe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4894:168"/> from the ceremoniall Law, as is before declared) mightily conquered by Chriſt; and therefore to reuiue againe the ceremonies, was to renue the bond, and to ſtand ſtill in danger of the Diuels executions.</p>
                  <p>The words are a moſt portly and deep allegorie, and they carrie newes of a remakable victorie: the battell was fierce, cruell, prodigiouſly difficult, bloudie on the beſt ſide, and if Chriſt had beene a iot leſſe then he was, there had been no remedie, nor hope. The battell was firſt fought between Sathan and man, with a depth of fraud and crueltie, and helliſh inuiſible ſpight:<note place="margin">Newes of a ſtrange victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> the day was loſt, man with the wofull iſſues of the conqueſt, was either caſt downe wallowing in bloud, or ſcattered with purſuing crueltie: no ſooner ſprouting in the life of nature, but ſmitten with the venome of ſpirituall infection, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with the bondage of more then cruell ſeruitude, not pittied, not helped: more forfeitures laid vpon him then hee could finde words to acknowledge. Now one man commeth into the field in the right of millions, (that could not ſtand in their owne quarrell) challengeth the victors, with ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion calleth backe the ſcattered, raiſeth a mighty expectation, expoſeth himſelfe to the danger, with incredible fury is encountred, one with millions or legions of Diuels, of incomprehenſible rage, and long beaten experience, and the infinite anger of God was kindled againſt this one man as a ſuretie for the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Now in this text is a report of the happie ſucceſſe of the battell; newes of a moſt victorious conqueſt: the Diuels ſpoyled, the Elect reſtored, with vnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable hymnes attend the conqueſt; the wretched ſpirits are in chaines, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to infinite ſhame, and dragged after the chariot of triumph, as hee aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the new Ieruſalem.</p>
                  <p>In generall two things may be obſerued: Firſt, that Chriſt is God; he was brought in before, quickning pardoning, filling, circumciſing the heart, now heere ſpoyling the Diuels, and triumphing ouer them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may heere comfort our ſelues with this, that the Diuell ſhall neuer haue ſucceſſe againſt Chriſt, and his kingdom, God hath curſed all his wayes: and yet we finde by experience, the Diuell will not giue ouer, though he hath neuer ſo ill ſucceſſe from day to day: which may awaken many wicked men, who are herein like the Diuell, no ill ſucceſſe can make them giue ouer their ill courſes. Againe, would wee not bee ſpoyled and croſſed in the ſucceſſe of that we take in hand, and be made like the Diuel in ill ſucceſſe, then let vs take heed of his qualities, be not like him in cruelty, in fraud, in lying, in accuſing, or enuying the children of God: for if thou be, thou art ſure with the Diuell, to be accurſed and rebuked of God.</p>
                  <p>Now for the particular opening of theſe words, wee muſt vnderſtand that they haue beene three wayes interpreted. Firſt, ſome Papiſts ſay this battell was fought in hell, when Chriſt fetched the Fathers out of <hi>Limbus:</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation I reiect, not onely as a fond conceit obtruded vpon the world, but becauſe the moſt popiſh writers could ſee no ſuch thing in this place, but expound it otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſome Orthodox writers ſay this battell and triumph was both begun and ended before Chriſts death. The Deuils encountred Chriſt two wayes vpon the croſſe: viſibly and inuiſibly. Viſibly, by inſpiring wicked men with vile prouocations to vex him, and moleſt him; as the impenitent theefe<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.38.</note>, the Rulers of the Iewes<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 33 38.</note>, and the ſouldiers<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.37.</note>. Inuiſibly, the Deuils themſelues, with all might, fury, malice, and ſleight encountred him vpon the croſſe, in the ſight of God and the holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>The victorie is deſcribed in this verſe, and it is ſayd firſt <hi>hee ſpoyled them,</hi> which is diuerſly read and referred; For ſome vnderſtand it, hee ſpoyled the Deuils: ſome of the Fathers put in a word, and read it, <hi>after hee had ſpoyled
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4894:169"/> himſelfe of his fleſh,</hi> and ſo it is a compariſon borrowed from wreſtlers, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that firſt put off all might hinder them; and ſo Chriſt that hee might ouercome, firſt layd downe his fleſh vpon the croſſe. And where the text ſaith, he made a ſhew of them openly, the Holy Ghoſt alludeth to the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of great Victors: their manner was, in the place where they did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, either to cut downe the armes of great trees, and thereupon hanged the ſpoyles or weapons of the vanquiſhed: or elſe they built ſome ſtately pillars, and there painted or wrote vpon, the conqueſt with other monuments of victorie; So did Chriſt openly ſerue the Diuels, openly before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the world hee defeateth them, and by a new way, by ſuffering, gaue occaſion to all to ſee the ſhaking of the helliſh kingdome; where he is ſayd to triumph ouer them, therein is an alluſion to the third degree of victorie, they were wont to lead their captiues after the chariot of triumph into the Citie with great pompe: thus did Chriſt to the wicked ſpirits, either vpon the croſſe, or in his reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But might ſome one ſay, what appearance was there of any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note place="margin">Chriſts victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> when Chriſt ſuffered? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Great euery way: for if wee obſerue it in euery branch of the proceſſe, there is euident ſignes of victorie; For doe they attach him? why firſt the officers are ſmitten to the ground with a very word,<note place="margin">1. In his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment.</note> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the cheefe leader is made to goe and hang himſelfe: the eare of <hi>Malchus</hi> was miraculouſly cured, and they are ſuffered to doe no iot more then will fulfill the Scriptures<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. 2. In his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment.</note>. Will they arraigne him in the Conſiſtorie? why there ſits a high Prieſt that was made whether hee would or no to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Chriſts death for the people<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.50. vvith 18.4.</note>; and Chriſt caſts a ſpirit of giddineſſe vpon the witneſſes, ſo as their teſtimonies could not agree: yea, he there fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels them of his moſt glorious and terrible ſecond comming in the clowds of heauen, and then miraculouſly recouers <hi>Peter</hi> a lapſed ſinner. Will they arraigne him in the common hall? why there he ouercomes by patience, no indignities could ſtir him, and the Iudges wife from a dreame giues warning that hee was a iuſt man, yea the Iudge himſelfe was compelled to pronounce him innocent.<note place="margin">3. Vpon the croſſe.</note> Will they haue him to the croſſe? there are wonders of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a theefe without meanes ſaued, the vaile of the Temple rent, ſignes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, and a title of victorie ſuperſcribed by his very aduerſaries, <hi>This is the King of the Iewes;</hi> beſides his incorruption in the graue, and glorious reſurrection, and viſible aſcenſion to heauen.</p>
                  <p>All this being conſidered, where is the ignominie of the croſſe, ſeeing the Deuils erected a croſſe for themſelues, when they plotted to crucifie Chriſt? And why ſhould we be afraid of ſuffrings, ſeeing the croſſe is Chriſts triumph? and let vs reſolue alſo to ouercome by ſuffrings<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.</note>; Tis an excellent and loftie praiſe to ouercome by ſuffring.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let vs neuer iudge of Chriſt or Chriſtians by their outward ſhew: great things may be done in the kingdom of Chriſt, which are not diſcerned by carnall reaſon; Here we ſee a great adoe, trophies, triumphs, yet the world tooke no notice of it: ſo is there incomparable glory euen in this world in the ſoules and liues of Chriſtians, which the blinde multitude neuer takes notice of. And thus much of the ſecond interpretation.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt interpretation, is of thoſe that limit not the time of this victorie to the croſſe, but conſider it generally, and in ſteede of the words <hi>[vpon the ſame croſſe]</hi> read <hi>[in himſelfe]</hi> and thus doe the moſt Interpreters new and old read it; And ſo this victorie is vnderſtood not ſo much of what Chriſt did attaine in his perſon, as what he doth in vs: by the conuerſion of ſinners, by the Goſpell, hee daily ſpoyles principalities and powers, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs ouer them, &amp;c. and ſo theſe words are a conſequent of the putting out of the hand-writing mentioned in the former verſe.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:4894:169"/>
                  <p>Foure things are in theſe words to bee conſidered: <hi>who, whom, what,</hi> and <hi>by what meanes.</hi> For the firſt, it is the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> that vndertakes this battel, he that is God and man, he of whom the propheſies ranne, he that by a voice from heauen at his baptiſme was acknowledged the only champion, twas he that ſent the challenge by his fore-runner <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> he it is that foyled Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in many <hi>Monomachies,</hi> this is he that now comes forth in the Goſpell in the ſeuerall ages of the Church to ſpoyle theſe principalities and powers.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond, the ſpoyled are called <hi>principalities and powers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Principalities and Powers]</hi> Theſe termes are giuen to the good Angels, Eph. 3.10. and to great Magiſtrates and Princes on earth, Eph. 1.23. In effect they are giuen to Chriſt, Eſay 9.6.7. but vſually they are reſtrained to euill angels, and ſo they are called either conſidering them as they were before their fall, or as it is vſually conceiued, it notes their eſtate euen ſince their fall.</p>
                  <p>The two words note two things in the euill Angels, <hi>Excellencie</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; Excellencie,</hi> ſo they are <hi>principalities; Abilitie,</hi> ſo they are <hi>powers.</hi> Their <hi>excellencie</hi> is two waies to be conſidered, 1. in themſelues. 2. their ſoueraignty ouer the world. In themſelues and their owne nature, euer ſince their horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fall, they are creatures of wonderfull knowledge, ſwiftneſſe, diſcerning, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>An in reſpect of the vnregenerate world they haue a principality: hence called <hi>worldly rulers</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">

We may obſerue here in the holy Ghoſt a wonderfull patterne of candor, he praiſeth what is praiſe-worthy euen in his enemies; and it may wonderfully comfort Gods children in their acceptation with God, for if God can yeelde theſe titles and acknowledge that is yet good in the very Deuils, ſure then it cannot be he ſhould not like what he findes good in his owne Saints, though they haue many wants and ſinnes, ſeeing they ſinne not of <hi>malicious wickednes,</hi> as the Deuils doe.</p>
                  <p>As they are called <hi>principalities,</hi> ſo for their abilitie and force of working,<note place="margin">The povver of the Deuils both in the vvorld and in the Church.</note> they are called <hi>powers.</hi> The wonderfull power the diuels haue may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either in the world or in the Church.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt race of men before the floud, how ſoone had they drawne away <hi>Cains</hi> race into apoſtaſie, and not long after <hi>Sethes,</hi> till they had chaſed the light of ſincerity within the walles of one houſe, and not all ſound there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? After the floud, the world is no ſooner filled againe, but together with the building of Babel, a moſt dreadfull confuſion was wrought by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, euen the beginning of a generall falling away into gentiliſme and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie (which will neuer bee vtterly recouered againe while the world ſtands) all the families making apoſtaſie in the beginning of the Babyloniſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, and ſuch an apoſtacie, as they continued in for many hundred yeeres in the generalitie of them: ſo as there was onely a little light left in the race of <hi>Sem.</hi>

                  <p>Now leauing the whole world lying vnder this powerfull wickedneſſe, come to <hi>Abraham, (a brand taken out of the fire of the Chaldeans)</hi> in whom the light ſhined with great glory, ſee the power of theſe wicked ſpirits ouer his race: the Iſmalites went quickely off to gentiliſme: then the Edomites were eaſily gained after: then in Aegypt the light that did remaine was almoſt put out, the bondage of the Iſraelites being as great in ſoule<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <p>In <hi>Moſes</hi> time the light was diffuſed in that people all abroad againe, and a <hi>kingdom of Prieſts</hi> was raiſed vp to God: this light held with various encreaſes and decreaſes, till the captiuitie, after which time it waxed dimmer and dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, till Chriſt the <hi>Day-ſtarre</hi> aroſe, and filled heauen and earth with the brightneſſe of his comming.</p>

This is a dragging of them out of their cels of darkneſſe in the light of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, by ſhewing their natures and practiſes, by vnmasking them to the view of the ſoule: thus are they diſplaied in the doctrine of the Goſpell, and the ſoules of the righteous behold this detection of Sathan from day to day by the word, with as much admiration as euer the <hi>Romans</hi> did behold any great rebell, or barbarous rebell or monſter, ſubdued, and in triumph brought into <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither may this detection of Sathan ſeeme to be the leaſt part of Chriſts victorie: for it is certaine it is a worke that euill men or euill angels neuer beare but vanquiſhed.

                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7.</note>. 2. It was continued in the publication of the Goſpell<note n="h" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note>, (which is newes of victorie) and in the life of Chriſtians; for what is the life of euery Chriſtian, but the ſhew of a brand taken out of the fire, or of a ſoule preſerued out of darkneſſe? The ſoule is mounted in the chariot of the word, praier and holy liuing; this chariot is followed with the applauſe of Angels, and the approbation of the Saints; the place is in the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> on earth, in the temple of their God. The chariot is drawne with white ſteeds, ſincere teachers; it is prouoked and driuen on by the ſpirit of God: and the effect of all is a heart inſpired with heauenly ioyes and refreſhings. 3. As it begun in Chriſt, and is continued in the life of a Chriſtian, ſo this triumph ſhall be perfected in death, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in the reſurrection to the eternall diſſolution and confuſion of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men and deuils.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4894:171"/> in repentance for their ſinnes: they had rather be his priſoners, then ſuch princes: rather ſlaues to Sathan, then ſonnes to God: rather dragged into captiuitie with the deuill, then carried in the chariot of triumph with the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If ſuch honors be done to Chriſtians, and ſuch ioyes had in a Chriſtian eſtate, oh then let it be the praier of euery godly man daily to God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the fauour of thy people, viſit me with thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>HItherto of the ſeuen reaſons of the dehortation. The concluſion followes in theſe words and the reſt to the end of the chapter: and it hath three branches. For 1. he concludes againſt Iudaiſme in theſe words. 2. Againſt philoſophie, verſ. 18.19. 3. Againſt traditions, verſ. 20. to the end.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words is contained both the concluſion it ſelfe, verſ. 16. and the reaſon, verſ. 17. and the drift is to ſhew that the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and therefore they ſhould not receiue them, or hold themſelues bound vnto them. This was foretold <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. it was ſignified by the renting of the vaile; and theſe ceremonies were ſolemnly and publikely laid downe, in the firſt Councell which was held by the Apoſtles at <hi>Ieruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. And they were then ſo laid downe, that the Apoſtle after giues order to the Church that thoſe ceremonies ſhould neuer be vſed, nor any other deuices, but ſuch as might be to edification, order and decencie, and were without offence.</p>
                  <p>The ceremonies named in the text, are the difference of meats and drinkes, and the obſeruation of times, concerning which hee writes more ſharply, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.12.</p>
                  <p>In the Law there were three ſorts of meats that legally were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: 1. The meat offerings. 2. The ſhew bread. 3. The cleane beaſts. The meat offering was a type of Chriſt our nouriſhment. The ſhew bread was a type of the Church in her myſticall vnion. And the cleane beaſts (knowne by chewing the cud, and diuiding the hoofe) were types of the Chriſtians both meditation and diſcretion, in the meanes of his holy conuerſation. And for the confirmation of this place, the Apoſtle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4894:171"/> elſewhere ſhewes euidently that the difference of meats is taken away, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.3.4.</p>
                  <p>The difference of times in the Law is here ſaid to be threefold; of dayes, of moneths, of Sabbaths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect of an holy day.]</hi> The originall and moſt tranſlations word for word haue it thus, <hi>in part of an holiday;</hi> but in diuers ſenſes: ſome ſay in part of an holiday, that is, in partition of a feſtiuall day from a not feſtiuall day, as well in dayes, as in moneths, or Sabboths. Some ſay, <hi>in part,</hi> for they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all ceremonies, being abſent from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle would haue them to receiue none at all, ſeeing they could not receiue them all. Some ſay in part of an holiday, that is, in that part of them which concernes dayes, &amp;c. But it is more plainly as it is here rendred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or of the new moone.]</hi> They did obſerue the Calends, or firſt dayes of euery moneth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or of Sabboth dayes.]</hi> There were diuers ſorts of <hi>Sabboths, of dayes, of yeeres, or ſeuens of yeeres.</hi> The Sabboths of dayes were either <hi>morall, viz.</hi> the ſeuenth day, which God did chuſe; or <hi>ceremoniall:</hi> the ceremoniall Sabboths were either more ſolemne, ſuch as were the three great feaſts, <hi>Paſſeouer, Pentecoſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>tabernacles;</hi> or leſſe ſolemne, ſuch as were the feaſts of blowing the trumpets<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.24.</note>, and the feaſt of expiation<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16.32 33.34.</note>. The Sabboth of yeeres was euery ſeuenth yeere<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.4.5.6. <hi>to</hi> 11.</note>. The Sabboth of ſeuens of yeeres was the Iubile, which returned euery fiftie yeeres. We ſee here then that the Apoſtle ſhewes that wee are deliuered from the bondage of the obſeruation as before of meats, ſo now of Sabboths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But is the Sabboth day that was morall abrogated? <hi>Sol.</hi> No, the Apoſtle ſpeakes here of the ceremoniall Law, not of the morall; and of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Sabboths, not of the morall Sabboth; the word is in the plurall number.</p>
                  <p>The manner of propounding the concluſion is to be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let no man condemne you.]</hi> Theſe words may be referred either to Gods children, or to falſe teachers. In the firſt ſenſe it is thus: <hi>Let none condemne you,</hi> that is, doe not ſhew ſuch loue to theſe ceremonies hereafter, that thereby you incurre iuſtly the blame and cenſure of Gods children. And if they bee referred to falſe teachers, then it is thus: let no man whatſoeuer perſwade you that you are condemned, or iudged of God for omitting the obſeruation of the ceremonies; care not for their cenſures, neuer trouble your conſciences about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which are ſhadowes of things to come.]</hi> Here the Apoſtle with full ſaile driues into the hauen, by ſhutting vp with this vnauoidable argument. Theſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are but ſhadowes of that ſubſtance which now we haue, and therefore it is a fooliſh thing to ſtriue about the ſhadow when we haue the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Ceremonies were ſhadowes in diuers reſpects. 1.<note place="margin">Ceremonies vvere ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovves in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> In reſpect of certaintie of ſignification: the ſhadow is a ſure ſigne of the body; ſo was this of Chriſt to come. 2. In reſpect of cauſation; the body cauſeth the ſhadow, ſo is Chriſt the cauſe of all ceremonies. 3. In reſpect of the obſcuritie of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: a ſhadow is darke, ſo were the ceremonies. 4. In reſpect of ceſſation: a ſhadow is quickly gone, ſo were the ceremonies, they were not to laſt for any long time. Laſtly, they were ſhadowes as they were types; ſo the lambe was a ſhadow of Chriſt, and the Arke of the Church, &amp;c. They were ſhadowes not giuen to iuſtifie, but to ſhew iuſtification by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is added, <hi>of things to come]</hi> to keepe off the blow from our Sacraments, which are no ſhadowes of things to come, but of things paſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the body is in Chriſt.]</hi> The words are diuerſly interpreted: ſome referre the words to the next verſe, but without reaſon: ſome ſupplie a word <hi>body,</hi> and reade, but the body is the body of Chriſt: but the plaine meaning is, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4894:172"/> the truth and ſubſtance of all the ceremonies is now enioyed by the Church in and by Chriſt, in whom all is now fulfilled, and therefore heauen ſhould now ſuffer violence, and the <hi>children of Sion ſhould now reioice in their King;</hi> and Chriſtians <hi>ſhould ſtand faſt in the libertie that is brought vnto them in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle makes foure obſeruations vpon theſe that bring in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels. 1.

That thoſe things were founded on no other foundation then the opinions of men immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately pleaſing themſelues in their owne deuices. 4. That this courſe tends to the high derogation of the honour of Chriſt, who only deſerues all glory, and by whom alone all the ſuits of the Church are diſpatched.

                     <hi>Let no man beare rule ouer you.]</hi> The originall word hath troubled Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but is for the moſt part rendred, either beare rule ouer you, and ſo play the part of a Iudge or rector; or elſe, defraud you of your prize: it is granted by all, to be a word taken from the manners, in the <hi>olympiads</hi> or other-where, who runne for prizes: among whom there was one they caled <hi>Brabeutes,</hi> that is, one that by appointment did ſit as iudge, and gaue the prize to the winner.</p>

                  <p>Which may ſerue for confutation of Papiſts, who at this day ſtill maintaine it, not only without commandement or any approued example in ſcripture, but directly againſt the prohibition of the Scriptures, as in this place, and ſo Reuel. 19. the Angell forbids <hi>Iohn</hi> to doe it.</p>

                  <p>And whereas they giue the knowledge of all things vnto them, they rob God of his glory, who onely is the <hi>knower of the hearts of men,</hi> 2. Chron. 6.30.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4894:173"/> and it is granted Iſay 63.16. that <hi>Abraham</hi> knew them not, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them. And whereas they obiect that <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> is ſaid to know that they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets bookes, we anſwer that that is ſpoken parabolically not hiſtorically; they may as well ſay that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> had fingers, and <hi>Diues</hi> a tongue, &amp;c. but were that granted, yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that becauſe the doctrine of the Church was reuealed vnto him, therefore he knew all things.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing they giue is adoration, contrary to the flat prohibition of the Angell himſelfe, in the Reuelation, who chargeth <hi>worſhip me not,</hi> Reuel. 19.10. and without all example in Scripture, or the leaſt ſillable of warrant for it; beſides we ſee here Angell-worſhip in expreſſe words condemned.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is inuocation, praying to them, which likewiſe is contrary to ſcripture, for <hi>how ſhall we call on them on whom we haue not beleeued</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In humblenes of minde]</hi> It was the practiſe of Satan and pretence of falſe Teachers, to thruſt in this corruption of Angell-worſhip vnder this colour, that it tended to keepe men in humilitie, and to make men to know their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the great maieſty of God, and to acknowledge their gratitude to the Angels for their ſeruice: this hath beene the Deuils wont to hide ſoule ſins vnder faire pretences, and vice vnder the colours of vertue.</p>

Such alſo are the open and wilfull Sabbath breakers, and many more of all ſorts of preſumptuous offenders.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if vice masked in vertues colours can ſo pleaſe, and allure men, how much ſhould vertue it ſelfe rauiſh vs? If counterfeit humilitie can be ſo plauſible, how ſhould true humilitie winne to the admiration and imitation of it?</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That one way to ſet out the fearefulneſſe of ſinne, is by the faireneſſe of the bleſſings loſt by it; the faireneſſe of the body of Chriſt ſhewes the fouleneſſe of lumpes of prophaneneſſe and apoſtacie.</p>

But I forbeare to pleade much for it, becauſe though God may force it, yet man ſhould not frame it: and it is a moſt happy abilitie to ſpeake punctually, directly to the point.</p>
                  <p>But in particular in theſe words the Church which is the body of Chriſt is praiſed fo foure things. 1. For her originall or dependance vpon Chriſt, <hi>of whom.</hi> 2.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4894:176"/> of Chriſt is the company of faithfull men, who by an vnutterable vnion are euerlaſtingly ioyned to Chriſt, though they are diſperſed vp and downe the world, yet in a ſpirituall relation they are as neere together as the members of the body are; if we be faithfull, there can be no ſeparation from Chriſt and Chriſtians, whatſoeuer become of vs in our outward eſtate.</p>
                  <p>This body of Chriſt is commended for three things, <hi>ornament, vnion,</hi> and <hi>growth:</hi> and well are all put together, for not one can bee without the other, eſpecially the firſt and the third cannot be without the ſecond.

There is great difference betweene our beſt garments, and our meaneſt members: the worſt member of the body will grow, yet the beſt raiment though it ſit neuer ſo neere will not: ſo is it betweene wicked men profeſſing Chriſt, and the godly that are members of Chriſt indeed.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe words is conteined the third branch of the concluſion, and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced againſt traditions: here I obſerue both the manner of propounding, and the matter. For the firſt, it is to be obſerued, that whereas he condemned the former by way of aduiſe, he condemnes theſe by bitter and tart expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>why are ye burthened with traditions,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, were there not a ſingulare proneſſe of nature to corruption, could they be ſo blinded, as to ſuffer falſe Teachers, to impoſe traditions vpon them?</p>
                  <p>In the matter conſider firſt what he condemnes, viz. traditions explicated in the kindes, v. 21. 2. The reaſons why he condemnes them and theſe, are ſix. Firſt, yee are dead with Chriſt, and therefore yee ought not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to traditions, of the force of this reaſon afterwards. 2. You are dead from the rudiments of the world, that is, from the ceremoniall lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which yet were as rudiments or wayes of inſtructing the world in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the kingdome of God, and therfore much more ſhould you now giue ouer traditions. 3. They are burthens, and the greater by how much the leſſe ſenſe you haue of them. 4. The matter of them is light, and vaine, and idle, ver. 21. 5. They are all corruptible, and periſh with the vſing. 6. They are after the counts and doctrines of men, ver. 22. <hi>Ob.</hi> But there ſeemeth to be a depth in theſe traditions. <hi>Sol.</hi> v. 23. He confeſſeth that they haue a ſhew of wiſdome, and that in three things. 1. <hi>In voluntarie religion</hi>

                        </gap>.</note>, which hee cenſures two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is but a ſhew or flouriſh, no true ſubſtance, either of worſhip or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. 2. It with-holds the honour due to the body.</p>
                  <p>Now that the whole may be better vnderſtood, we muſt diſtinctly conſider what he meaneth by tradition, which will appeare if it be conſidered negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with compariſon with the two former.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are not things required by Scripture any way: For all ſuch were condemned vnder the firſt kinde, viz. ceremonies, which though now abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, were once required.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not ſuch rites beſides Scripture, as are practiſed with opinion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4894:177"/> of worſhip, for they are condemned vnder the ſecond kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>So then the traditions here condemned, are ſuch rites, cuſtomes, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, as men binde their conſciences to, to obſerue or practiſe in the ciuill life of man. Beſides the inſtances in the text, ſuch are the obſeruation of euill daies, or houres to be borne in, or to marry in, or to ſet out on a iourney in; the rules obſerued about infants vnbaptized, as that they muſt not be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or they muſt lye in a ſieue, or ſuch like about women that lye in. Such is the not marrying with kinred at the font, as they call it; ſuch are the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſignes of ill lucke, or of death gathered from the crying of birds, or the running of beaſts; ſuch is praying at the lighting vp of candles, and the burning of candles ouer the dead corps, or the naming of children with names that agree to men and women, to make them liue the longer; ſuch is, not burying on the north ſide of the Church, and the like ſilly traſh, with which ſimple people abound more then is ordinarily obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore if yee be dead with Chriſt]</hi> In theſe words diuers things may be obſerued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here we ſee the neceſſitie of our vnion with Chriſt, the Apoſtle will not a done with it, he remembreth it ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When he ſaith, <hi>if yee be dead,</hi> it implies that men may make a faire ſhew, and profeſſe long, and liue in true viſible Churches, and yet it is a queſtion whether they be in Chriſt or no, <hi>If yee be dead with Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Note here the praiſe of a mortified life, for when he ſaith, <hi>if yee be dead in Chriſt,</hi> it imports that to be ſo, is an excellent condition: to be truly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Chriſt, is a rare happineſſe; to die with Chriſt, is better then to liue with the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Penitent ſinners haue life and death, ioyes and ſorrowes &amp;c, common with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In ſpeciall they haue death common with Chriſt. They die with Chriſt, 1. Becauſe Chriſts death was theirs: when Chriſt died they died, becauſe his death was for their ſakes, and for their benefit. 2. Becauſe when their bodies die they die in vnion with Chriſt. 3. Becauſe the vertue of Chriſts death is deriued to their ſoules: whence flowes, <hi>death to the law,</hi> that is, a releaſe from the rigour and curſe of it. 2. <hi>Death to ſinne,</hi> that is, a power to mortifie ſinne, conueyed in the ordinances of Chriſt, and applied by the ſpirit of Chriſt. 3. The preſence of Chriſt in all the duties of mortification, though they be done neuer ſo ſecretly, yet Chriſt is with them.</p>
                  <p>The vſe may be both for tryall and comfort. For tryall, art thou not dead with Chriſt in reſpect of the mortification of thy corruptions? then art thou not in Chriſt. For comfort to the mortified, thou art in Chriſt, and he will neuer <hi>leaue thee nor forſake thee,</hi> till he hath raiſed thy body and cured thy ſoule. Thus of the words in themſelues; they are alſo to be conſidered as they are here vſed againſt traditions, and ſo they are two waies.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is dead, and in his death yee are freed from all bondage of ſoule to any thing but the will of God, and therefore 'tis a diſhonour to Chriſts death and the freedome purchaſed in it, to make our ſelues ſeruants to traditions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You are dead with Chriſt, that is, you are mortified perſons, and theſe things are too light for any graue and penitent perſons, to take vp his thoughts or cares about them; fleſhly perſons are onely capable of this traſh, mortified perſons without teaching ſuſpect them.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the rudiments of the world]</hi> The ſecond reaſon ſtands thus; if by the death of Chriſt yee be freed from the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were then rudiments, or as it were the firſt grounds of inſtruction, then much more are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4894:178"/> you freed from traditions, which are but beggerly obſeruations, that no body can tell whence they came, or what good they doe. This ſhould be of force to preuaile with vs againſt the multitudes of idle traditions that raigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why as though yee liued in the world are yee burthened &amp;c.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Doe not the faithfull liue in the world, that he ſaith with ſuch a ſalt interrogation, <hi>as though yee liued in the world?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They liue in the world corporally, yet not in the world in reſpect of their profeſſion of ſpirituall and celeſtiall life: ſo Chriſts kingdome was not of this world. 2. In reſpect of ſubiection to all the frame of rites and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations of the world: they liue not as men that are tyed and vowed to the ſeruice of the world in whatſoeuer obſeruations it ſhall propound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Burthened]</hi> Traditions are a grieuous burthen to the ſoule, and the worſe, the leſſe they are felt: Men will not willingly ſuffer vniuſt impoſitions in their free holds in the world, nor ſhould men ſuffer the world to impoſe burthens vpon their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>The word alſo notes the audacious liberty of the impoſers; before they peſtred the Church with the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then they corrupted Gods worſhip with philoſophicall dreames, ſuch as was the worſhip of Angels, now they proceed further, they clogge the ciuill life of man and his priuate affaires with imperious obſeruations.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the third reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As touch not, taſte not, handle not]</hi> Theſe words muſt be vnderſtood to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd <hi>mimeticωs,</hi> in a kind of ſcorne; ſee the wicked ſubtiltie of the Deuill, he turnes himſelfe into all formes to ruine vs: Once he deſtroyed the world by tempting man to eat, now he goeth about to poyſon mens ſoules with reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them from eating.</p>
                  <p>Some obſerue that the haſte of the words without copulatiues, notes their eagerneſſe in preſſing theſe things, and perſwading men to the care of them; ſure it is, men of corrupt mindes are more eager about theſe then about weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters.</p>
                  <p>Some learned, render touch not, by eat not, and ſo note a gradation. Firſt, they would not haue them eat, then not ſo much as taſte, and when they had gotten them to that, then not ſo much as to handle: <hi>Ambroſe</hi> runnes againſt the ſtreame of all Interpreters, to vnderſtand theſe words to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Apoſtle. Thus of the fourth reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which all periſh with the vſing]</hi> Theſe words are two waies interpreted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They bring deſtruction to the vſers, they are a doctrine of diuels, and make men the children of hell. This is true, but not the truth of this place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are of a periſhable nature, and therefore men ought not to load their conſciences with neceſſitie of obſeruing them.</p>
                  <p>This is the nature of all outward things, they periſh with the vſing, all is <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of the fleſh is <hi>but as the flower of the field</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay.</hi> 40.</note>, <hi>ruſt or moth doth corrupt them</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.</note>, euen crownes are corruptible<note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.24.</note>. Here we ſee a cleare difference between earthly things, and ſpirituall: Earthly things not onely in the abuſe, but in the very vſe, are either worne out or leſſe regarded, or haue leſſe vigor, faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, power, &amp;c, but cleane contrary with ſpirituall things: why ſhould we not then moderate our loue to theſe outward things? why ſhould we not ſtriue <hi>to vſe this world as if we vſed it not,</hi> no more <hi>truſting in vncertaine riches?</hi> This ſhould alſo ſtir vs vp to the care of ſpirituall graces and duties, that neuer periſh, that we may attaine that <hi>vncorruptible crowne of righteouſnes,</hi> which God will giue to all <hi>that loue his appearing:</hi> The very daily periſhing of foode and rayment, are types of thine owne periſhing alſo. Thus of the fifth reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And are after the commandements and doctrines of men]</hi> The reaſon ſtands
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4894:178"/> thus, whatſoeuer hath no better warrant then the commandement and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men, is to be reiected as a burthenſome tradition: But theſe things are ſuch, therefore why are yee burthened? See the wretched diſpoſition of mens natures, how ready men are to preſcribe, and how eaſie men are to be led on in theſe fooliſh vanities. But are the commandments of God ſo eaſily obeyed? Are the doctrines of Gods word ſo willingly imbraced? Alas, alas, mens examples, or counſell will eaſily paſſe for lawes, but the Lord is as if he were not worthy to be heard in the practiſe of the moſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſix reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Now followes the obiections. Though theſe things were not commanded in the word, yet they were wiſely deuiſed by our fathers, and therefore are to be obſerued. <hi>Sol. v.</hi> 23. The Apoſtle grants that there were three things alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to approue the diſcretion of the founders of theſe things, and inſtanceth in one kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> abſtinence or faſting, for that he confeſſeth that had a ſhew of <hi>voluntary,</hi> not coacted or forced <hi>religion.</hi> 2. Of <hi>humbleneſſe of minde.</hi> 3. Of the taming of the body; but when he hath granted this, he doth daſh all as it were with thunder and lightning, when he ſaith: 1. This was but <hi>a ſhew of wiſdome.</hi> 2. This ſparing did with hold <hi>the honour due vnto the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerue here that it is a faire propertie to vſe candor and ingenious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the truth, and willingly to acknowledge what they ſee in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the aduerſaries, we ſee the Apoſtle fairely yeelds the full of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not mangling them, but ſetting them out diſtinctly, and then confutes them. It were happy if there were this faire dealing in all reaſonings publike and priuate, in print or by word of mouth, in all that profeſſe to loue the truth eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shew of wiſdome]</hi> There is a wiſdome only in appearance, and in mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in name onely. Some men haue wiſdome, other haue the praiſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But in matters of conſcience and religion, it is dangerous for man to lift vp himſelfe in his wiſdome, or to admit the varniſh of carnall reaſon. The wiſeſt worldly men are not alwaies the holieſt, and moſt religious men, Oh that there were an heart in vs, indeed to acknowledge and to ſeeke the true wiſdome that is from aboue.</p>
                  <p>The colours caſt vpon their traditions were three. 1. Voluntarie religion. 2. Humbleneſſe of minde. 3. The taming of the body: All theſe as baſe varniſh, to ſmeire ouer mens inſolent wickedneſſe, are here reiected. Which may confirme vs in the deteſtation of popery, euen in that wherein it makes the greateſt ſhew: What are their workes of ſupererogation, their vowes of ſingle life, their canonicall obedience, their wilfull pouerty, and the like, what can be ſaid or ſhewed in their praiſe, which was not pretended for theſe tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? The Apoſtle here giues warning, let not men be deceiued, theſe faire pretences of our Papiſts, are but the old obiections of the falſe Apoſtles, new varniſhed ouer againe by the Pope, and his vaſſals: Oh that our ſeduced mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude would conſider this? then would they not be thus led to hell with their faire ſhewes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing in this verſe is the Apoſtles reaſon againſt theſe colours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They haue it not in eſtimation to ſatisfie the bodie or fleſh]</hi> That is,<note place="margin">The body is to be honored for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> they yeeld not due honour to the body: the body of man is to be honoured, for firſt the ſonne of God (as the Fathers ſay) made it with his owne hand, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the body he aſſumed. 2. The ſoule a diuine thing is kept in it, and helped by it in great imployments. 3. The ſonne of God tooke the body of a man into the vnitie of his perſon. 4. He redeemed the body by his bloud, and feedes it with the ſacramentall body. 5. The body is the temple of the Holy Ghoſt. 6. It is conſecrate to God in baptiſme. 7. It is a part of the myſticall body of Chriſt. Laſtly, it ſhall be gloriouſly raiſed at the laſt day.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4894:179"/> Then let men know, they muſt giue account that diſhonor their bodies, and if theſe ſuperſtitious perſons muſt reckon for it, that puniſh their bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commandement from God, where ſhall theſe beaſts appeare that ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their bodies by gluttony, and drunkenneſſe, and luſt, and whoredome, and cruelty, and murther? Oh the condemnation that abides theſe impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, that glory in their ſhame, and minde onely to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto the Apoſtle hath intreated of matters of faith: now hee intreateth in theſe two Chapters of matters of life: preſcribing rules for conuerſation,</p>
               <p>Theſe rules are either generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The generall are from verſe 1. to 18. The particular are from v. 18. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to v, 2. of the fourth Chapter.</p>

               <p>The mortification of euill followes; and ſo he intreates, firſt of the mortification of vices that concerne our ſelues moſt, verſ. 5.6.7.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.6.7.</note> Secondly, of the mortification of iniuries, v. 8.9.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 8.9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt there is both the matter to be mortified, &amp; the reaſons.</p>
               <p>In the firſt there is two things: 1. the propoſition of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:4894:180"/> 
                  <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are on earth.</hi> 2. The catalogue of vices to be mortified, which are either againſt the ſeuenth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>fornication, vncleaneſſe, inordinate affection:</hi> or againſt the tenth Commandement, <hi>euill concupiſcence:</hi> or againſt the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>couetouſneſſe which is Idolatrie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons are taken, firſt from the euill effect, which is the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> amplified by the perſons on whom it falls, <hi>the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> v. 6.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 6.</note> Secondly, from experience, <hi>in which yee alſo walked when ye liued in them,</hi> v. 7.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus of the mortification of vices.</p>
               <p>The mortification of iniuries followes: where obſerue, 1. the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it ſelfe. 2. the reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>In the exhortation there is two things: 1. The charge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>put away all theſe things.</hi> 2. The catalogue of iniuries to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, are either the ſinnes of the heart, or the ſinnes of the tongue: the ſinnes of the heart, are <hi>anger, wrath, malice:</hi> the ſinnes of the tongue, are <hi>curſed ſpeaking, filthy ſpeaking, lying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons are three: Firſt, Ye haue put off the old man and his workes, v. 9.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 9.</note> Secondly, Ye are renued: which is explicated by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this new birth is in generall, <hi>the putting on of the new man:</hi> in particular, it is the renuing of the <hi>minde with knowledge,</hi> and of the whole man, with <hi>the image of Chriſt,</hi> v. 10.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 10.</note> Thirdly, God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of perſons, without grace he will reſpect none, and with it he will diſregard none, for with him there is neither <hi>Graecian nor Iew,</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion nor vncircumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond, free. Chriſt is all in all things, v. 11.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto of the ſecond thing needfull to holy life: viz. the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of vices. The third followes, viz. the exerciſe of holy graces and duties, from v. 12. to 18. and here the rules concerne either 1. the matter of holineſſe, v. 12. to 16. or the meanes of holineſſe, v. 16. or the end of holineſſe, v. 17.</p>
               <p>For the firſt he giues in charge nine graces: but firſt propoſeth three motiues. 1. the election of God, <hi>as the elect of God.</hi> 2. their ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>holy.</hi> 3. the loue of God to them, <hi>and beloued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The graces are of three ſorts: ſome of them haue their greateſt praiſe in proſperitie, viz. <hi>mercy, kindneſſe, meeknes, humblenes of minde:</hi> ſome of them concerne the times of aduerſitie principally, viz. long-ſuffering and clemencie in forbearing and forgiuing, v. 12.13.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 12.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some of theſe graces ought to raigne at all times, &amp; theſe are three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Loue, which is ſet out both by the dignitie of it, <hi>aboue all put on loue:</hi> and by the vſe of it, <hi>it is the bond of perfectneſſe,</hi> v. 14.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Peace, amplified by the author, <hi>of God:</hi> by the power of it, <hi>let it rule:</hi> and by the ſeat of it, <hi>in your hearts.</hi> to which he exhorts by two reaſons: 1. from their vocation, <hi>to which ye are called:</hi> 2. from their mutuall relation, <hi>as members of one body,</hi> v. 15.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third is thankfulnes or amiableneſſe, v. 15.</p>
               <p>Thus of the matter of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>The meanes followes, which is the word.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4894:180"/>
               <p>The exhortation to the vſe of the word, 1. concernes the word in generall. 2. the Pſalmes in ſpeciall. For the firſt he propounds three things: 1. the author of it, <hi>the word of Chriſt.</hi> 2. the manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the word, <hi>let it dwell in you plenteouſly in all wiſedome.</hi> 3. the end or vſe it ſhould be put to, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach in what we know not, and to admoniſh in what we doe not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part concernes the Pſalmes in particular, where he ſets downe the ſorts, <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs:</hi> and the right manner of ſinging of Pſalmes, <hi>ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> Thus of the meanes of holines, v. 16.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing is the end, which is conſidered two waies: Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 17.</note> as the end of intention, that wee aime at, and ſo hee exhorts to it in theſe words, <hi>whatſoeuer yee doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> 2. as the end of conſummation, that finiſheth our workes, and ſo they muſt <hi>giue thankes to God euen the Father by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus of the rules of holy life, that concerne all men as they are Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Now follow particular rules fitted for particular callings, and that in the familie. In the familie there are three couples: Wiues and Husbands, Children and Parents, Seruants and Maſters, and to theſe he giueth rules diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Wiues dutie is laid downe and inlarged: laid downe in theſe words, <hi>Wiues be ſubiect to your Husbands:</hi> inlarged, firſt by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>it is comely.</hi> 2. a limitation, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> v. 18.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Husbands duty is propounded, 1. by exhortation, <hi>Husbands loue your Wiues.</hi> 2. by dehortation, <hi>be not bitter to them,</hi> v. 19.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The dutie of children, is laid downe, in theſe words, <hi>Children obey your Parents:</hi> and amplified, 1. by the extent, <hi>in all things.</hi> 2. by reaſon, <hi>for this is well pleaſing to the Lord,</hi> v. 20.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The duty of Parents is expreſt by dehortation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 21.</note> in theſe words, <hi>Parents prouoke not your children to anger:</hi> and confirmed by a reaſon taken from the ill effect, <hi>leſt they be diſcouraged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, In ſetting downe the duty of Seruants, there is firſt the exhortation, v. 22.23. the reaſons, v. 24.25.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 22.23.24.25.</note> The exhortation is both briefly laid downe in theſe words, <hi>Seruants be obedient to them that are your Maſters:</hi> and explicated, 1. by prouiſoes about their obedience. 2. the manner how they muſt obey.</p>
               <p>The prouiſoes are two: one reſtraines Maſters, they are their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants but <hi>according to the fleſh:</hi> the other extends the dutie of ſeruants, they muſt obey <hi>in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manner how they muſt obey is ſet downe, firſt negatiuely, <hi>not with eye-ſeruice, not as men-pleaſers:</hi> ſecondly, affirmatiuely, and ſo they muſt obey, 1. <hi>With ſinglenes of heart.</hi> 2. <hi>With feare of God.</hi> 3. <hi>Heartily as to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons are two: firſt, from the certaine hope of reward from God, v. 24. Secondly, from the certaine vengeance of God vpon them that doe wrong.</p>

And the firſt thing you ſhould be carefull of in the right order of your liues, is to raiſe vp your thoughts and affections to the ſtudie and contemplation of heauenly things; for hereby you doe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proue that you are riſen vp in the firſt reſurrection with <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi> And heauenly things are aboue, and therefore for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe fitting your contemplation; and for their difficultie, they cannot be reached without ſeeking, and diligent ſtudie, and inquirie.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. For ye are dead &amp; your life is hid vvith CHRIST in GOD.</note>Now there are excellent reaſons by which I may briefly ſtir you vp here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; both from the conſideration of your preſent eſtate in this world, and from the meditation of your future condition in the day of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> In this world two things ſhould much moue you. Firſt, that yee are but dead men; for both you profeſſe the forſaking of the world, and the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of you but as dead men: and your affections drowne and ouerwhelme you many times. Secondly, the ſpirituall happineſſe which you haue, which is the life of your life, is hid alwaies from wicked men, who haue no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in or diſcerning in ſpirituall things: and ſometimes by the violence of tentation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. When CHRIST, vvho is our life, ſhall appeare, then ſhall yee alſo appeare vvith him in glory.</note> your ſelues diſcerne not your owne happineſſe. Yet be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, it was ſo with <hi>CHRIST</hi> while he liued; and though it be hid, yet is it hid with <hi>GOD,</hi> it is in him, it is in his power, and he will preſerue it.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially if you thinke of the comming of <hi>IESVS CRIST</hi> you ſhould be ſtirred to the loue and ſtudy of heauenly things: for then ſhall there
<pb facs="tcp:4894:181"/> be an end of all earthly felicities, then ſhall men make accounts of all their actions and ſtudies, then will not riches auaile in that day of wrath, then will the incomparable gaine and glory of godlineſſe be diſcouered: Oh the invaluable dignitie of heauenly minded Chriſtians in that day! And thus of the meditation of heauenly things.</p>
               <p>The ſecond maine part of my exhortation ſhall concerne the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of vices and crimes. Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. Mortifie therefore your members vvhich are on earth, fornication, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, the inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and couetouſneſſe, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is idolatry.</note> I would hence obſerue thoſe ſpeciall ſinnes which are moſt hatefull to <hi>GOD</hi> in your former courſe of life, and then haue beene moſt prone to. When I ſay, mortifie, I meane that you ſhould vſe all the meanes indefinitely that ſerue to kill the power and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of thoſe ſinnes, neuer giuing ouer confeſsion and godly ſorrow till you finde the power of them abated and deaded. And this I would haue you doe not onely in outward ſinnes, but any ſinne, though they were as deare to you as the very members of your bodies, yet you muſt cut them off. Now ſome of the ſinnes that I would haue you ſtudious to auoide or mortifie are theſe: firſt, looke to the filthineſſe condemned in the ſeuenth Commandement, not onely auoide whoredome, but all kindes of wicked fleſhly filthines and vncleannes; yea look to that internall burning or the flames of luſt within, that habituall effeminateneſſe, and paſsions of luſt: and more then all this ſee that you make conſcience of euill thoughts, and that contemplatiue wickednes, which may be in your mindes without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the will to practiſe it: for euen thoſe thoughts are filthy in <hi>GODS</hi> ſight. Now the laſt ſinne I will name is couetouſnes, which is a kinde of vile idolatry in <hi>GODS</hi> ſight.</p>
               <p>For theſe and ſuch like ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. For the vvhich things ſake the vvrath of GOD commeth vpon the children of diſobedience.</note> bring downe the fearefull iudgements of <hi>GOD</hi> vpon the offenders; and they wonderfully vex <hi>GOD:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to liue in theſe ſins, and loue them, and continue in them, is a manifeſt ſigne, that they are but wicked men, children of diſobedience, whatſoeuer they ſeeme to be, or what ſhewes or profeſsion ſoeuer they make.</p>
               <p>And the rather ſhould you be for euer carefull to keepe your ſelues from theſe euils, and the like, or ſpeedily to ſubdue them, &amp; forſake them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. In vvhich yee alſo vvalked ſometime when ye liued in them.</note> ſeeing you haue felt by experience in your vnregenerate eſtate what it is to haue ſinne like a monſter to liue and reigne in the heart or life.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo make conſcience of iniurious dealing with others,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. But novv put ye avvay euen all theſe things, anger, vvrath, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, curſed ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, filthy ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of your mouth. <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. Lie not one to another, ſeeing that yee haue put off the old man vvith his workes. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. And haue put on the nevv man, vvhich is renevved in knovvledge after the image of him that created him.</note> and that not onely of the groſſe acts of iniuries, but of doing wrong in your very words, yea in the paſsions of your heart: yea to approue that now ye walke not in ſinne, ſhew your vprightnes, by putting away euen euery thing that might tend to the iniurie of others. To expreſſe my meaning I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in diuers ſins, the vnregenerate would make no conſcience of. And firſt in the heart there is inward fretting, and that paſsion that diſcouers it ſelfe by outward ſignes, and that inveterate anger called malice: theſe you muſt make conſcience of. Beſides in the tongue there are three vices you muſt alſo auoide, <hi>viz.</hi> curſed ſpeaking, filthy ſpeaking, and lying.</p>
               <p>There are three weighty conſiderations ſhould moue you thereunto. Firſt, when you repent of ſin, you profeſſe to put off the old man and his works; this old man is the old Tempter of your natures, and his workes are ſuch as theſe fore-mentioned paſsions, and diſtempers in the tongue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you are now in the ſtate of grace, you are new men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:4894:182"/> muſt not liue after the old manner: you are renewed in knowledge to diſcerne theſe things to be euill, and therefore ought to ſhew it in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: and you are renewed after the image of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> now there was no guile found in his mouth, nor any of theſe wretched perturbations in his heart, and therefore how ſutable ſoeuer they be to the harmony of the moſt men, yet for that reaſon you muſt keepe your ſelues farre from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

Thus of the ſecond maine thing needfull to holy life, viz: the mortification of vices and iniuries.</p>

For the firſt there are nine graces ſhould principally be remembred in your practiſe: and that you may be quickned thereunto, be much in the meditation of three things, <hi>1. GODS</hi> election. <hi>2.</hi> Your owne ſanctification. <hi>3.</hi> The loue of <hi>GOD</hi> to you.</p>
               <p>The graces are, <hi>1.</hi> Tenderneſſe in all ſorts of iniuries. <hi>2.</hi> Curteſie. <hi>3.</hi> True and hearty humilitie and lowlineſſe. <hi>4.</hi> Quietneſſe and meeknes, and tranquillitie of heart. <hi>5.</hi> Long-ſuffering in reſpect of croſſes.</p>

And this forgiuing muſt be extended to euery man, and it muſt be as Chriſt forgaue vs, and that is though they be our inferiors, &amp; though they haue done vs great wrong, &amp; ſo as we forget aſwel as forgiue.</p>
               <p>But ſeuenthly, aboue all other be ſure you cloth your ſelues with loue, for this will knit vs together perfectly, and by this all the Saints, and all the graces of the Saints tend vnto perfection.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Get the peace, that peace I meane that <hi>GOD</hi> only giues, and let it rule and preuaile with you, and if you cannot be at peace in your life, yet let it be in your hearts ſtill, how vnreaſonable ſoeuer men be, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould you be carefull hereof, both becauſe you are called of <hi>GOD</hi> to it, and beſides you are all members of the ſame body. Laſtly, adde vnto all theſe, amiablenes and thankfulnes one to another. And thus of the matter of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt alſo ſtirre you vp to a due reſpect of the meanes of holines, which is the word.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. Let the vvord of CHRIST dvvel in you rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all vviſdom, teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing one another in <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymmes,</hi> and ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging vvith grace in your hearts to the LORD.</note> And ſo both the word in generall, and the Pſalmes in ſpeciall. For the word in generall, you muſt remember it is the word of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> both as the ſubiect, and the cauſe of it: and you ſhould neuer be ſatisfied till you grow familiar and plentifull in it, through the daily vſe of it, both in your hearts and houſes alſo, and that with all iudgement and diſcretion; not ſeeking or vſing it, coldly, peruerſly, carnally, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly: and this word you muſt imploy both to teach you and one another, what you know not, and to admoniſh you and other for what you doe not. And in ſpeciall be carefull of the Pſalmes, remembring that they alſo are the word of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and the rather conſidering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb facs="tcp:4894:182"/> variety of ſweet matter in them, but in ſinging obſerue theſe rules: Firſt, exerciſe the graces of the heart according to the matter of the Pſalme. Secondly, doe it with attention and vnderſtanding. Thirdly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>GODS</hi> glory in it and his holy preſence.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, be carefull of the end of all your actions,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. And vvhatſoeuer yee ſhall doe in vvord or deede, doe all in the name of the LORD IESVS: giuing thanks to GOD euen the Father by him. <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. Wiues ſubmit your ſelues to your Husbands as it is comely, in the LORD. <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands loue your Wiues, and be not bitter vnto them. <hi>Verſe</hi> 20.

But he that doth vvrong, ſhall receiue for the vvrong that he hath done: &amp; there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons.</note> both that all be done to the glory of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> (all I ſay both in word and deed) beginning with calling on the name of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and ending with the ſacrifice of thankſgiuing, which muſt be offered vnto <hi>GOD</hi> in the mediation of <hi>CHRIST</hi> aſwell as your prayers. Thus I haue briefly laid before you the rules that concerne holineſſe as you are Chriſtians in the generall.</p>
               <p>Now I thinke it meete to propound ſome duties that are more particular: and I will onely inſtance in the familie: and there I begin with Wiues, whoſe word is, be ſubiect, an epitome of their duty, and a thing <hi>GOD</hi> moſt ſtands vpon, and which Women moſt faile in. And great reaſon, for here lieth the true comelineſſe and beauty of a Wife, tis not in her face and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in her ſubiection to her Husband. And the rather ſhould you be ſubiect, becauſe <hi>GOD</hi> hath prouided, you ſhall not be preſſed, but in the <hi>LORD,</hi> not in any thing againſt the word.</p>
               <p>Now for Husbands their word is loue, as that <hi>GOD</hi> moſt ſtands vpon and they moſt faile in. And in particular I giue them warning to looke to one vice aboue many, and that is, that they be not bitter to their Wiues.</p>
               <p>And for children their word is obedience, and they must know that <hi>GOD</hi> ſo inioynes it, that he will haue it done throughly, they must obey in all things, and ſubmit their wills and deſires to their Parents. For this is a thing that will not only keepe and increaſe their Parents loue to them, but it is alſo wondrous well-pleaſing to <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Parents alſo muſt take heed they ſin not againſt their children, not only by too much indulgence, but alſo by prouoking them, and that not onely to ſin, but to paſsion, by vniuſt precepts, or contumelies and diſgraces, or hard vſage, or immoderate correction: and that as for other reaſons ſo leſt they be diſcouraged either from loue of well-doing, or of obeying them.</p>
               <p>You that are Seruants muſt alſo with great care attend your duties, your word alſo is obedience: and the rather becauſe your Maſters haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie but onely ouer your fleſh, not ouer your conſciences; but in your obedience ſee to it, it be in all things that concerne the ſubiection of the outward man. But let not your ſeruice be onely when your Maſters looke on, or fitted onely to pleaſe men, but obey euen in the ſingleneſſe of your hearts, as in <hi>GODS</hi> preſence, where you ſhould feare to diſpleaſe.</p>
               <p>Neither let what you do be done out of a ſlauiſh feare, but from the heart with all willingnes, as doing therein ſeruice to <hi>GOD,</hi> and not to men only.</p>
               <p>Knowing infallibly that if men would not reward you for your paines &amp; faithfulnes, yet <hi>GOD</hi> will, who will not vſe you as ſeruants, but prouide for you as ſons and heires to him. For in all this labor <hi>GOD</hi> accounts you as the ſeruants of Chriſt, and will reward all as if all had bin done to him.</p>
               <p>And contrariwiſe he that doth wrong be he Maſter or Seruant ſhall receiue of the <hi>LORD</hi> for the wrong that he hath done: for <hi>GOD</hi> is no accepter of perſons.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ITHERTO of Chriſtian doctrine,<note place="margin">The Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> now followeth Chriſtian life. The Apoſtle hath before diſcourſed of matters of faith: now hee intends to entreat of matters of life:<note place="margin">The diuiſion of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and to preſcribe rules of conuerſation. And theſe rules belong either to our generall calling as wee are Chriſtians, or to our patticular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as wee are people of ſuch or ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſtate of life.</p>
                  <p>The generall rules are ſet downe from the firſt verſe of this Chapter to the eighteenth, and the particular rules begin at the eighteenth verſe, and continue to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe of the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The rules of the firſt kinde may be referred to three heads, for either they concerne, firſt the meditation of heauenly things, or ſecondly,<note place="margin">The ſubdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vice, or thirdly, the renouation of life. The meditation of heauenly things ir vrged from v. 1. to the fift, the mortification of vice is vrged from v. 5. to the tenth. Renouation of life is generally layd down v. 10.11. and more ſpecially opened v. 12. to the eighteenth.</p>
                  <p>The exhortation to the care and ſtudy of heauenly things is thus dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Firſt it is expounded v. 1. Secondly it is illuſtrated v. 2. Thirdly, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by motiues and reaſon, v. 3.4. And thus for the order of the whole Chapter, and the generall frame of this firſt part.</p>
                  <p>Before I open the words more particularly there are diuerſe things may be noted from the coherence and dependance of theſe words,<note place="margin">4 Doctrine from cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vvith former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> with the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, and the matter following in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>From the coherence with the former Chapter, I obſerue theſe things. Firſt, that there can bee no holineſſe of life without faith: and therefore the Apoſtle firſt inſtructeth them in matters of faith. It is a true rule, <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne,</hi> and may be extended further then things indifferent, while we are out of Gods fauour,<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</note> and know not our reconciliation and iuſtification in Chriſt, our beſt actions are but faire ſinnes. <hi>For without faith it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the terreſtriall bleſſedneſſe of man is in reſpect of ſinne, two wayes principally aſſaulted. Firſt, with errors in opinion. Secondly, with corruptions in manners. And againſt both, wee ſhould learne from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the latter part of the former Chapter, and the firſt part of this, to bee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4894:185"/> armed and furniſhed with holy directions and meditations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that theſe men that are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly earneſt, and ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly forward for ceremonies, and the traditions, and obſeruations of men, whatſoeuer they proteſt, or pretend, or ſeeme to be, are indeed voyd of true deuotion, and feruent affection to heauenly things <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Fourthly, that hee that is by faith made a new creature, muſt reſolue to be at Gods appoyntment for his whole carriage in his generall and particular calling<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. Doctrines fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coherence in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the coherence with the former Chapters. From the order of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this Chapter two things may be noted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that before a man can be good in his <hi>particular calling,</hi> hee muſt firſt be good in his <hi>generall:</hi> thou mayſt bee painefull and diligent, but thou canſt not be euery way a faithfull and ſound hearted husband, wife, ſeruant, childe, &amp;c. till thou bee a good man or good woman, in reſpect of grace and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore wee ſhould <hi>firſt ſeeke the righteouſneſſe of Gods Kingdome,</hi> and it may ſerue for direction, vnto ſuch as chuſe wiues, or ſeruants, or the like: if they bee not faithfull to God, how canſt thou bee aſſured they will prooue faithfull to thee? moreouer, wouldſt thou haue thy ſeruants or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to bee amended, then bring them to the powerfull preaching of the word, and call vpon them to get into the fellowſhip of the godly, that they may learne to bee good abroad in matters of religion, and then thou mayſt hope to finde them by proofe and daily experience, truſty and faithfull in thy <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> buſineſſe. Finally, this reproues both the ſinfulneſſe and folly of many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall parents and maſters, they neuer care ſo their ſeruants doe their worke, though they altogether neglect <hi>Gods worke.</hi> And many times they reſtraine their ſeruants and children, and will not let them heare ſermons, or come into godly companie, as if that were the way to make them idle and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: whereas we ſee the cleane contrary to be true.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that men are neuer likely to hold out and prooue ſound in the reformation and new obedience of their liues, till they fall in loue with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things, and grow in ſome meaſure weary of the world and the things thereof.</p>
                  <p>

                        </gap>.</note>Thus of the generall obſeruations from the twofold coherence. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the particular opening of the words.</p>
                  <p>In the propoſition of the exhortation to the ſtudie of heauenly things, layed downe in this verſe, two things are to bee conſidered; firſt, what: or the dutie required, viz. ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue? ſecondly, why: or the reaſons to enforce the dutie, and they are foure. Firſt, ye are riſen with Chriſt in the firſt reſurrection. Secondly, theſe things are aboue, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without ſeeking or ſtudie. Thirdly, Chriſt is aboue in his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Fourthly, Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, exalted in the glory of his father, each of theſe ſtrongly conclude the exhortation, as will further appeare in the particular handling of them.</p>

                  <p>Now the conſideration of this worke is heere vſed by the Apoſtle to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vnto the meditation of heauenly things: and that fitly: for if wee bee riſen as Chriſt was, then we muſt bee minded as hee was: now wee know that after hee was riſen againe, hee was not encumbred with this world, nor did he conuerſe with the men of this world, but liued with the Lord as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, in a heauenly manner, waiting for Heauen: ſo ſhould a Chriſtian doe: he ſhould euery day bee ſtriuing to get vp his heart, by faith and prayer and meditation, and voluntary abnegation, by all meanes begging and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the vertue of Chriſts reſurrection, that being enabled to forſake the world and the vnneceſſary ſociety with worldly men, he might haue his heart and <hi>conuerſation in heauen,</hi> euery day <hi>waiting when the time of his changing ſhould come.</hi>

                  <p>The workes of the fleſh, and the corruptions of life to bee auoyded, and not affected, are the third ſort of things on earth: but of that alſo afterwards in the ſecond part of the generall duties; eſpecially in the fifth verſe. So that the ſecond ſort of things on earth remaineth to bee more largely conſidered, thoſe are profits, honours, pleaſures, friends, health, and long life.</p>
                  <p>There be eight reaſons to perſwade not to affect earthly things.<note place="margin">Eight generall reaſons to diſſwade from affecting things on earth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt may bee taken from the condition of man on earth. For wee are heere but <hi>pilgrims and ſtrangers</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</note>, and therefore being but in a ſtrange place, to what purpoſe ſhould wee trouble our ſelues with more then what will ſerue our preſent need, and the rather knowing that when wee come into our owne countrey, theſe things will ſerue vs for no vſe. Beſides, our preſent lot lyeth not in thoſe things: but the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> is our portion, euen in this life, all other things are but caſt vpon vs, as additaments.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond may bee taken from the diſability of earthly things. For firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they cannot ſo much as fill or ſatisfie a mans heart. 2. They cannot fence a man againſt any of the trials of God, when the <hi>houre of tentation comes</hi>

                        <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.10.</note>. 3. They cannot all of them <hi>redeeme one ſoule</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon may bee taken from the inconueniences that follow the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> loue of earthly things. For, firſt <hi>the cares of the world choake the word,</hi> that it can neuer proſper<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.</note>. 2. They breede excuſes and ſhifts in mans mindes and alienate by degrees a mans heart from the vſe of the meanes<note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk</hi> 14.17.</note>. 3. To ſeeke after the world is to <hi>ſorrow after the world:</hi> for to the moſt the world is a cauſe of much ſorrow and vexation. 4. <hi>The amity of the world,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>is the enmitie of God</hi>

                  <p>The fourth reaſon may bee taken from the ſoueraignty that God hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> all earthly things: and the power hee hath giuen to Chriſt ouer them<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18.</note>, now why ſhould wee turmoyle our ſelues with care about theſe, ſeeing they are in Gods hand in Chriſt, to haue them and diſpoſe of them as may bee for his glory and our good.</p>
                  <p>The fifth reaſon may be taken from the baſeneſſe of the nature of all theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> things: for they are not onely <hi>on the earth,</hi> but <hi>of the earth:</hi> and if they bee compared vnto the ſoule of man, for which wee ought cheefely to prouide, the whole world is not worth one ſoule: which may appeare both by the price of a ſoule, and the diſproportion betweene the gaines of the world and the loſſe of one ſoule:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.</note> it is <hi>no profit to winne the whole world and loſe a mans owne ſoule:</hi> and beſides, if the whole world layd on one heape would haue beene a ſufficient ſacrifice for the redemption of the ſoule, the Lord Ieſus would neuer haue abaſed himſelfe to ſuch a ſuretiſhip. But becauſe there could not be found, neither in heauen nor earth, <hi>any other name</hi> or nature <hi>by which wee could be ſaued,</hi> therefore hee <hi>humbled himſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and was obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the croſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixt reaſon may bee taken from the example of the Lords Worthies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> who in all ages haue beene <hi>tried</hi> with all kinde of <hi>trials:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> and <hi>wandred vp and downe in ſheepe-skinnes and goat-skinnes, being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented, wandring vp and downe in wilderneſſes, mountaines, and dennes, and caues of the earth, whom the world was not worthy of:</hi> all theſe ſeeking another country, and <hi>willingly profeſſing that they expected no abiding place heere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, it is ſomewhat to perſwade vs, that our Sauiour Chriſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4894:189"/> of purpoſe to hinder and interrupt our reſt and eaſe in the vſe of thoſe things: when hee ſaith, that hee <hi>came not to ſend peace,</hi> as knowing that much peace and liking of earthly things was vnprofitable for vs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we may bee mooued by the conſideration of the fleeting condition of all earthly things: <hi>riches haue wings</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Prou.</note>, and the <hi>faſhion of this world paſſeth away</hi>

                  <p>But that we may be the more deepely affected with the contempt of the world, I will further adde theſe reaſons,
<list>
                        <item>1. Of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of all ſinfull men.</item>
                        <item>2. Of Chriſt, the wiſeſt of all men.</item>

                     <hi>Salomon</hi> in his booke of Eccleſiaſtes is exceeding plentifull, and indeede not without cauſe:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Salomons</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the loue of earthly things.</note> for ſuch is the ſtrength of the rooted loue of earthly things in many men, that they had neede to bee encountred with an armie of reaſons, and if I ſingle out ſome of the cheefeſt out of diuers chapters, I hope it will appeare tedious to none, but ſuch as will heare no reaſon.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt chapter, among other things theſe may bee noted. 1. That after a man hath trauelled to get what hee can, how ſmall a portion in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the whole hath hee atchieued? ſo as hee may ſay to himſelfe when hee hath done, <hi>What now remaineth to mee of all my trauell which I haue ſuffered vnder the ſunne?</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.3.</note> 2. If a man could get neuer ſo much, yet hee cannot liue to enioy it long. For the elements of which man was made, are more durable then man himſelfe: for, <hi>one generation paſſeth and another commeth, but the earth remaineth ſtill</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 4.5.6.</note>. The like may be ſhewed of the aire and water. 3. <hi>All things are full of labour no man can vtter it</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>. And certainly, many times earthly things gained, anſwer not the labor ſpent about them. 4. Earthly things poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, will not ſatisfie, <hi>The eye will not bee ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the eare with hearing</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>. 5. A man can compaſſe nothing that is new, for <hi>there is nothing new vnder the ſunne</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 9 10.</note>. Is there any thing of which one may ſay, behold this is new, and neuer was before? they haue beene already in the olde time that was before vs. 6. The Lord in wonderfull wiſdome and righteouſneſſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in the nature of man, thoſe cares that they may bee <hi>trauels to humble and breake the heart of man</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 13.</note>. 7. The beſt of theſe will not make a <hi>crooked thing ſtraight</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note>: they wil not mend the peruerſe manners of men, a man may bee and continue vicious for all theſe things, or for ought they will doe vnto him.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond chapter wee may obſerue theſe reaſons. Firſt, let a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto himſelfe the fulleſt and faireſt vſe of all ſorts of earthly things: pleaſure,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</note> laughter, great houſes, gardens, orchards, waters, fruit-trees, woods, ſeruants, cattell, ſiluer and gold, treaſures and muſicke, yet all theſe will not deliuer a man from ſatiety, loathing and vexation of ſpirit. So as hee may truely ſay, <hi>there is no profit in them.</hi> 2. In theſe things there is <hi>one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to all: it befalleth to the wiſe man as it doth to the foole</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 14.15.</note>. 3. Let a man excell neuer ſo much, yet within a ſhort time all will bee forgotten. <hi>For all that, that now is, in the dayes to come ſhall all bee forgotten</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>. Fourthly, when thou haſt gotten all thou canſt together, thou knoweſt not whether hee ſhall bee a wiſe man or a foole, that ſhall enioy them after thee<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 19.</note>. Fiftly, to attaine thoſe things men vſually ſpend their dayes in ſorrow, trauaile and greefe, and their hearts take no reſt in the night<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 23.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the third chapter theſe further reaſons may bee noted. Firſt, all things are ſwayed with the ſwinge of their ſeaſons and times.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</note> So as nothing is ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though bee borne, and now plant and build, and laugh, and daunce, and embrace, and ſow, and loue, and liue in peace: yet there will bee a time to plucke vp, and breake downe, and weepe, and mourne, and caſt away, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4894:189"/> hate, and mourne, and die too. Secondly, though the Lord ſhould ſet the world in a mans heart, yet hee might ſpend all his dayes and neuer know the full nature of theſe things<note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 11.</note>. Thirdly, all things are ſubiect to Gods vnauoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſing. Let man get what hee can, yet God will haue the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it: and <hi>whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, it ſhall abide, to it can no man adde, and from it can none diminiſh. And this God will doe that man may feare him</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>. Fourthly, ſuch is the ſtate of the children of men, that they may loſe all they haue at the very <hi>place of iudgement</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>. Fiftly, yea the verie ſtate of mortified men, in the reaſon of carnall men, becauſe of theſe oppreſſions and vncertainties, ſeemes little better then the ſtate of beaſts<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth Chapter note,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.1.2.3.</note> firſt that when a man hath ſet his heart vpon theſe earthly things, if euer hee loſe them, he is filled almoſt with vnmedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable teares and ſorrow, ſo as hee would <hi>praiſe the dead aboue the liuing,</hi> and wiſh he had neuer been borne. Secondly, they are occaſions of a mans enuie<note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note>. Thirdly, the eying of theſe things infatuats many a mans heart: ſo as wee may ſee many a man that hath neither ſonne nor daughter, nor brother, and yet there is no end of his trauell, and he hath not the iudgement, to ſay with himſelfe, <hi>for whom doe I trauaile, and defraud my ſelfe of pleaſure</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>. Fourthly, a man may get much with ſore trauaile, and liue to ſee himſelfe deſpiſed of him for whom he prouideth them: ſo as they that ſhall come after him will not reioyce in him.<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 15.16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fift chapter there are alſo ſeauen other reaſons. Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8.</note> theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things leade the greateſt men into bondage, by dependance. For the <hi>King cannot conſiſt without the tilling of the field.</hi> Secondly, <hi>hee that loueth ſiluer ſhall not bee ſatisfied with ſiluer, and hee that loueth riches ſhall bee without the fruit thereof</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note>. Thirdly, when goods encreaſe, they are encreaſed alſo that eate them, and what good commeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes<note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note>. Fourthly, many times the ſeruant ſleepeth, when the maſter can get no ſleepe<note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 11.</note>. Fiftly, there is an euill ſickneſſe often ſeene vnder the ſunne, that riches are kept for the owners ruine<note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note>. Sixtly, or elſe they will periſh while the maſter looketh on<note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 13.14.15.</note>. Seuenthly, but certaine it is, he can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nothing out of the world when hee goeth, but muſt leaue them where hee found them.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixt Chapter there are theſe reaſons. Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1. to 7.</note> a man may haue all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and yet not haue a heart to vſe them, and ſo bee worſe then an <hi>vntimely fruit.</hi> Secondly, what needs all this adoe: for <hi>all is but for the mouth,</hi> and nature is content with a little. And therefore to haue a ſoule ſo vnſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably greedy of hauing, is a prodigious madneſſe<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>v</hi> 7.</note>. Thirdly, the hauing of all theſe things makes not a wiſe man better then a foole: &amp; what wants a poore man, if hee know how to carry himſelfe with the wiſe. Fourthly, all cannot make thee ceaſe to be mortall. <hi>For it is knowen man cannot ſtriue with him that is ſtronger than he</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">v. vlt.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeuenth Chapter there is this reaſon. A man may ſpend all his dayes before hee can come ſoundly to know (after many trialls) what is the beſt vſe to put theſe earthly things to.</p>
                  <p>And for honour, in the eighth Chapter three things are worthy noting. Firſt, <hi>a man is not Lord of his owne ſpirit,</hi> to keepe himſelfe aliue in his honour<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 8 8.</note>. Secondly, many men rule to their owne ruine<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note>. Thirdly, men after death are quickely forgotten. They that come backe from the holy place remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth them not long. Yea, a man may be quickly forgotten in <hi>the City where he hath done right</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And in the ninth Chapter, two reaſons more are added. Firſt, no man can know the loue or hatred of God by theſe things. Secondly, they are not gotten alwayes, by helpe of meanes. For the race is not alwayes to the ſwift,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4894:190"/> nor the battell to the ſtrong, nor riches to men of vnderſtanding, nor fauour to the wiſe: which makes the Atheiſt and Epicure conclude, that time and chance commeth to all things.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of all that <hi>Salomon</hi> can ſay is, vanity of vanities all is vanity. And now that wee haue heard <hi>Salomon,</hi> let vs in the next place heare a greater than <hi>Salomon.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Our Sauiours reaſons.</note>Our Sauiour Chriſt in the ſixt of <hi>Matthew,</hi> diuides the care of earthly things into two ſorts. For either men are greedily tranſported with the deſire of getting treaſures, that is, abundance and ſuperfluities: or elſe they toyle their hearts with diſtruſtfull and diſtracting cares, about neceſſaries, as what they ſhall eat, and what they ſhall put on.

                  <p>IN this verſe and the next the exhortation is confirmed by two motiues: the one taken from the condition of the faithfull in this world; the other taken from the confideration of their eſtate in the reuelation of the glory of Chriſt in the laſt day. The firſt is in this verſe, the latter in the next.</p>
                  <p>There are two things in the condition of the faithfull on earth which ſhould make them little to minde earthly things, or deſire to continue long in the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that in reſpect of diſtreſſes, they are as dead men while they liue. Secondly, that the happineſſe they haue (which is the life of their liues) doth not appeare, but is hid with God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For yee are dead.]</hi> The faithfull are dead three wayes while they liue:<note place="margin">The faithfull dead three vvayes.</note> For firſt they are dead to ſinne in reſpect of mortification. Secondly, they are dead to the Law, by the body of Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19.</note>, in reſpect of iuſtification: ſo as now the faithfull doe no longer wait vpon the Law for righteouſneſſe, but vpon a ſecond mariage they haue it from him that was raiſed from the dead for them.</p>
                  <p>They are dead to the world, and that in three reſpects. Firſt, in reſpect of their owne voluntary forſaking of the world, and their mortifying of earthly deſires, ioyned with a ſenſe of their owne mortalitie: ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> as a man crucified to the world<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</note>. Secondly, in reſpect of the worlds account of them. For ſo ſoone as men get any true grace, and retire themſelues from the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the time, they are neglected and forgotten as dead men out of minde. Thirdly, in reſpect of the multitude of afflictions which doe many times ouerwhelme and drowne Chriſtians. It is not vnuſuall in Scripture to ſay of men in deſperate croſſes they are dead men. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> cals the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in captiuitie dead men, when he ſaith, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall liue</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>With Chriſt.]</hi> The life of Chriſt alſo was hid while hee liued. For firſt the glory of his diuinitie was couered as it were with a vaile in his fleſh. Secondly,

Fiftly, his glory in heauen is hid from the world, and the Saints on earth haue but a glimpſe of it. All this may comfort vs, ſeeing nothing can befall vs but what hath befallen our head: and if the world will not acknowledge our glory, and the beautie of the profeſſion of ſinceritie, it matters not, it could not ſee the excellencie of Chriſt when he was on earth.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the knowledge of thoſe laſt things is not a curious or vnprofitable <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>1</label> knowledge, but contrariwiſe ought to be ſearched after, as exceeding vſefull in the life of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the doctrine of the glory of Chriſt and Chriſtians in that laſt day <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>2</label> is now but little knowne or diſcerned; and that the word <hi>appeare</hi> imports:<note place="margin">The Deuill, ſenſualitie and guiltineſſe, make many men haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle minde to thinke of the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſo as the fulneſſe of Chriſts maieſtie, or of the Chriſtians glory will not appeare till the very iudgement day. The better ſort know but in part: and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort are ſo blinded by the deuill, and beſotted with ſenſualitie and the loue of earthly things, and withall are ſo conſcious to themſelues of the euils they are guiltie of, that they haue no deſire to diſcerne, or to be taught to know the doctrine of Chriſts comming.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>3</label> 3. Thoſe words <hi>(which is our life)</hi> are not to be altogether paſſed ouer, they plainly affirme that Chriſt is our life,<note place="margin">Chriſt is our life.</note> and this is an honor that the Lord chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to himſelfe: and therefore as hee would be acknowledged to be the <hi>way</hi> and the <hi>truth,</hi> ſo alſo he addeth, <hi>I am the life</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6.</note>, and to this end he <hi>came, that men in him might haue life</hi>

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10.</note>. And with great reaſon is Chriſt ſaid to be our life, for he formed vs at firſt when we were not, and quickened vs when wee were dead, and hath prouided a better life for vs, and doth preſerue vs vnto eternall life, and daily renew life and power in the hearts of his people, and will raiſe our bodies at the laſt day.<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note> The conſideration hereof may both teach vs and trie vs; it may teach vs, as to acknowledge that wee haue receiued life from Chriſt, ſo to dedicate what remaineth of our life to the honour and ſeruice of him, that is the author and ſole Lord of our liues; and withall to runne vnto him for the daily preſeruation and renewing of life and louelineſſe in vs. And it may trie too: for till we can truly ſay out of feeling and experience, Chriſt is the life of our liues, we ſhall hardly finde reaſon of comfortable hope in our appearance before him at the laſt day.<note place="margin">Who may truly ſay and profeſſe, that <hi>Chriſt is their life.</hi>
                     </note> And they only may truly profeſſe that Chriſt is their life, that firſt can liue by the faith of Chriſt, accounting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue enough if they may ſee comfort in Gods promiſes made in Chriſt, and feele the ioyfull fruits of Chriſts fauour and preſence, howſoeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it goe with them for outward things. Secondly, that doe continually ſacrifice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and deuote vnto Chriſt their beſt deſires and endeuours, and that with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to cleaue to his ſeruice all the dayes of their life. And thirdly, that can bewaile his abſence, or diſpleaſure, as the moſt bitter croſſe: ſo as they could feele, and out of affection ſay of ſuch times and ſuch a condition, that the true life of their life was abſent or remoued from them.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the appearance of Chriſt. I haue not here to doe with the appearance of Chriſt as it is conſidered in the fore-ordination of God before the foundation of the world<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. Six appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt.</note>; but of the accompliſhment of it, and ſo Chriſts appearance is of diuers kindes. For firſt, hee hath appeared vnto the whole world, as <hi>the true light that made the world, and lightneth euery man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.10.</note>: and thus he appeared in the light of nature. Secondly, he appeares to the whole Church, conſiſting both of good and bad, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of doctrine and Scripture, but <hi>many receiue not his teſtimonie</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.31.32.</note>. Thirdly, he hath appeared corporally, in <hi>the dayes of his fleſh, once in the end of the world, to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5.</note>, and <hi>to diſſolue the worke of the deuill</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8.</note>. Then was fulfilled that <hi>great myſterie, God was manifeſted in the fleſh</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note>. Fourthly, he hath and doth daily appeare in the hearts of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by the manifeſtation of the ſpirit of grace<note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note>, whereby hee doth not onely ſhine, but alſo dwell in them<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16.17</note>. Fiftly, he hath and doth appeare in the day of death, by the miniſterie of his Angels, to tranſlate the bleſſed ſoules to their place of peace, reſt, and ioy. And laſtly, hee ſhall appeare in the end of the world in glorious maieſtie, to iudge all men and Angels, and this is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance here mentioned.<note place="margin">Threefold iudgement. The doctrine of the laſt iudgement hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vrged.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is noted to be a threefold iudgement. The <hi>firſt iudgement,</hi> and that was accompliſhed on man and Angels at their firſt fall. Then there is a <hi>middle iudgement,</hi> and ſo God iudgeth the wicked and the righteous euery day. And there is a <hi>laſt iudgement,</hi> and that is this iudgement about which Chriſt is here ſaid to appeare.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of the laſt iudgement is in a manner onely to bee found in the Church. They were darke and vncertaine things, the Philoſopher could ſee by the light of nature. And the Lords meſſengers haue in all ages from the firſt beginning till now, mightily vrged the terror of this day, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſecure world. <hi>Henoch</hi> propheſied of it<note n="l" place="margin">

                        <hi>Iud.</hi> 6.</note>. Neither is the aſſurance of the Iudgement to come warranted by the words of Gods ſeruants onely, but the Lord hath left many works of his owne, as pledges that he will once at length for all iudge the whole world for ſinne. The drowning of the old world, the burning of <hi>Sodome,</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.</note>, were aſſured fore-tokens that the Lord would not put vp the infinite iniquities of the world, but will moſt ſeuerely puniſh for ſinne. The pleading of the conſcience<note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.16</note> foretels a iudgement to come. The ſentence of death pronounced in Paradiſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with ſuch terror on Sinay, did euidently aſſure that God meant to call men to an account. The leſſer iudgements in this life are but fore-types of that laſt and greateſt iudgement to come. And laſtly, the dragging of men out of the world by death is nothing elſe but an Alarum to Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Yet as there is a neceſſary vſe of the knowledge of this dreadfull and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine, ſo there is a reſtraint to be laid vpon vs.<note place="margin">Be vviſe to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie.</note> This is one of the things wherein we muſt be wiſe to ſobrietie<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom</hi> 12.3.</note>. We muſt repreſſe the itching of our eares, and be content to be ignorant of what is not reuealed: this is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be inquired into more for vſe of life, then to feed the curioſitie of contemplation.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Iudgement to come, if any aske, <hi>Who ſhall iudge?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Who ſhall iudge.</note> I anſwer, that in reſpect of <hi>authoritie,</hi> the whole Trinitie ſhall iudge; but in reſpect of the <hi>execution</hi> of that authoritie, Chriſt onely ſhall iudge, and that as man<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17 31.</note>. It is true that the Apoſtles and the Saints are ſaid to iudge the tribes of Iſrael, and the world: but they only iudge as <hi>aſſeſſors,</hi> that is, they ſhall ſit as it were on the bench with our Sauiour Chriſt when he iudgeth.</p>
                  <p>And if any aske in the ſecond place, <hi>Whom Chriſt ſhall iudge:</hi> I anſwer,<note place="margin">Who ſhall be iudged.</note> he ſhall iudge the <hi>euill Angels;</hi> for <hi>they are reſerued in euerlaſting chaines vnder dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnto the iudgement of the great day.</hi> Hee ſhall iudge alſo the <hi>man of ſinne,</hi>

                        <hi>Iud.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.</note> euen the great Antichriſt, that hath made ſuch hauocke in the Church, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the nations with the wine of his fornications: euen <hi>him ſhall he conſume with the brightneſſe of his comming</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8.</note>. He ſhall iudge alſo <hi>all reprobates,</hi> men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, of all ages, nations and conditions: for though he ſhall <hi>not know them</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.12.</note> in reſpect of approbation, yet he ſhall iudge them, and make them vnderſtand he knew their tranſgreſſions. Further, he ſhall iudge <hi>the very elect,</hi> though it ſhall be with a different iudgement: for <hi>we muſt all appeare before the tribunall ſeat of Chriſt, that euery one may receiue the things which are done in his body</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</note>. Laſtly, in ſome ſenſe it may be ſaid he ſhall iudge the whole world: for the heauens and the earth that now are, are kept (by the word of God) and reſerued vnto fire againſt the day of condemnation, and of the deſtruction of vngodly men<note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note>. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the feruent deſire of the creature (made ſubiect to vanitie by man) waiteth for this reuelation of the ſonnes of God at the laſt iudgement: for they are ſubdued vnder hope, and ſhall at that day by the ſentence of Chriſt be deliuered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom</hi> 8.19.20.21. Where ſhall it be.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if any aske where this iudgement ſhall bee, I anſwer, that ſeeing the Lord hath not determined it, it is curious to enquire, and more curious to aſſigne the very place: as ſome haue, that wrote it ſhould be in the valley of <hi>Iehoſhaphat;</hi> or as others would haue it, on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> whence he aſcended. This wee know, it ſhall be neere the earth, in the clouds of heauen,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17.</note> where Chriſts throne ſhall be ſet: and further then this we need not enquire.</p>
                  <p>There haue beene alſo many opinions about the time when it ſhould bee.<note place="margin">When ſhall the day of Iudgement be.</note> Some thought, that as the world was ſix dayes in creating, and then the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both of reſt came; ſo the world ſhould laſt 6000. yeeres (reckoning a 1000. yeeres as one day) and then ſhould come the eternall Sabboth. Others diſtribute the times thus, 2000. yeeres before the Law, 2000. yeeres vnder
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4894:193"/> the Law, and 2000. yeeres after the Law, and then comes the iudgement. Others thought the world would laſt after Chriſt ſo long as it was to the floud from the creation, and that was as they ſay, 1656. yeeres. Others thought it ſhould be as long to the iudgement after Chriſt, as it was from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, and that ſhould be 1582. yeeres. This experience hath proued falſe. Other ſay Chriſt liued 33. yeeres, and the world ſhould continue for 33. Iubilies after Chriſt. What can be ſaid of all or the moſt of theſe opinions and ſuch like, but euen this, that they are the blinde fancies of men? For is there not a plaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint laid vpon men, in this queſtion, when the Lord Ieſus ſaid, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power</hi>

                  <p>But letting theſe things paſſe, the principall things for vs to be informed in as concerning the day of iudgement, and this laſt appearance of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, are theſe three: firſt, <hi>the ſignes</hi> of his comming.

Fourthly, the viſible creatures are Gods greate booke to proclaime the inuiſible things of God: now they ſtand alwaies ready and reading too, and men will not learne by them. And ſo theſe good maſters loſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4894:194"/> all their labour, and this is a bondage to bee tied to teach ſuch as will not learne. Fiftly, the creature is made not only the inſtrument, but many times the ſubiect of mans puniſhment for his ſinnes. As the earth is made iron, and the heauens braſſe for mans ſake, and this is a great bondage. Sixtly, the creature intends immortalitie, which while it failes of in the dying or expiring of the particulars of euery ſort, it would ſupply for the preſeruation at leaſt of the kindes, by a perenniall ſubſtitution of new particulars in euery kinde: and yet loſeth all this labour, becauſe all things muſt be diſſolued, and muſt be reſtored by another way knowne to God, and not now to nature. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the creatures may be ſaid to be in bondage, becauſe ſince the fall, the more illuſtrious inſtincts and vigors of the moſt of the creatures are darkned, decaied, dulled and diſtempered in them. Oh but might ſome one ſay,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> how can this bondage be aſcribed vnto the heauens? <hi>Sol.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note> The heauens are not ſo perfect, but they may admit enlargement of their excellencie. Beſides, they ſerue now promiſcuouſly to the vſe of bad as well as good, neither are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heauens without their feebleneſſe, and the manifeſt effects of fainting old age. And therefore by a <hi>proſopopoeia</hi> they may be ſaid to groane together with the reſt of the creatures vnder the common burden and vanitie vnto which they are ſubdued. It is obſerued, that ſince the dayes of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Sunne runnes neerer the earth by 9976. Germane miles, and therefore the heauens haue not kept their firſt perfection.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note> There is no neceſſitie to include the Angels in the number of the groaning creatures: and yet it will bee eaſie to ſhew that they ſuſtaine a kinde of bondage; for they are now made to ſerue earthly things, men haue their Angels to attend on them. And it is thought they haue a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie or preſidencie either ouer nations, or in mouing the orbes of heauen. Beſides, they are put to inflict puniſhments on wicked men, as on <hi>Sodome.</hi> Further, they performe ſeruice ſometimes not attaining their owne ends. And laſtly comparatiuely, at leaſt their felicitie in the creation was not ſo abſolute as it ſhall be in Chriſt: for if his comming adde not vnto them a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent condition of nature, yet out of all queſtion it addes a fuller meaſure both of knowledge and ioy.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Firſt, they ſhall haue freedome from all the former bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and vanitie. Secondly, they ſhall bee deliuered into the libertie of the ſonnes of God, that is, they ſhall haue a moſt excellent eſtate, when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are glorified. Wherein the Lord ſhewes his iuſtice, in that the creature ſhall haue reſtitution for what is loſt by man. <hi>Ob.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth conſequent of the iudgement ſhall be the poſſeſſion of the glory of Chriſtians appointed by the ſentence of the Iudge. But of this afterwards in the end of this verſe.</p>
                  <p>The fift conſequent of iudgement ſhall be the deliuering vp of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Father, and ſo the laying downe of Chriſts office: for when Chriſt hath finally and fully ſubdued Sathan, death and wicked men, and hath fully reconciled the elect to God, then will there be no word of any ſuch gouernment in heauen as was on earth. Hee ſhall not neede any longer to rule them, either by ciuill Magiſtrates, or by his need and diſcipline, or by any other way, which onely did agree to the times of the Churches warfare and pilgrimage: but he ſhall neuer ceaſe to liue and triumph with them, in all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4894:195"/> perfections of happy contentment and glory. Thus of the conſequents of Iudgement. And thus alſo of the doctrine of Chriſts laſt appearance. The vſes follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Vſes.</note>The conſideration of the doctrine of the laſt Iudgement, may ſerue for three principall vſes. Firſt, for terror. Secondly, for comfort. Thirdly, for inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this is iuſtly a wonderfull terrible doctrine to wicked men, that heape vp wrath againſt this day of wrath, and by their wilfull impenitencie prouoke this glorious Iudge. How can it but be terrible, when the holy Ghoſt giues warning that the Lord Ieſus will then ſhew himſelfe from heauen, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, to render vengeance on all thoſe that know not God, and haue not obeyed the Goſpell? How can it bee but terrible, when wicked men ſhall be puniſhed with euerlaſting perdition, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power? How can it but be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when they ſhall feele their conſcience exquiſitly griping them, and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon them, and when they ſhall ſee the deuils to torment them, and hell to deuoure them; when they ſhall ſee the world burning about them, and the good Angels forcing them away, and all both men and Angels applauding their Iudgement, and knowing all their ſinnes: they muſt not thinke that the Iudge will deale then as he doth now. Now he iudgeth them ſecretly euery day, but it is many times inſenſibly, or with leſſer plagues: but then he will moſt openly poure vpon them the full vials of his wrath. Heere they are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they may be amended, but there their iudgement ſhall be that they may be confounded: for there will be no place of repentance. Deceiue not thy ſelfe, Chriſt will not come the ſecond time as he came the firſt: hee came then to be iudged, but now to iudge; hee ſhall then be ſeene with terror, that was before looked vpon with contempt: hee ſhewed his patience in his firſt comming, but now he will ſhew his power: he appeared then in the forme of a ſeruant, but now he will appeare in the forme of a King, greater then all Kings. Then hee profeſſed not to iudge any man, but now he proclaimeth hee will iudge all men. It was commonly thought if any man ſaw God he ſhould die: alas, alas, how then ſhall theſe wofull wretches doe that muſt ſee him in the vnutterable fiercenes of his irefull indignation? If the powers of heauen ſhall be ſhaken at his pleaſure, oh how ſhall the miſerable heart of the guiltie ſinner be rent into 1000. peeces, with vnmedicinable ſorrowes? If <hi>Foelix</hi> tremble to heare tell of iudgement, what will poore <hi>Foelix</hi> doe when he muſt feele iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in the ſentence and execution? If the word of Chriſt on earth had ſuch power as it had in the garden, to ſtrike ſtubborne hearted men to the earth, what power (thinke wee) will it haue when be ſpeakes as the Lord from heauen? When <hi>Ezechiel, Daniel,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> and others ſaw but one Angell, in a leſſer manifeſtation of his glory, comming as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of good tidings, they fall downe, and are full of ſingular feare: if the ſight of one Angell bee ſo terrible, what will the ſight of all the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands of Angels be? eſpecially when they come cloathed with all their brightneſſe of glory? And if good men that had good conſciences were ſo frighted, what ſhall become of euill men with their euill conſciences? And if the meſſengers of good tidings doe ſo amaze, how ſhall the executioners of a moſt terrible ſentence compaſſe them about with confuſion both of face and heart? If the drowning of the old world, the burning of <hi>Sodome,</hi> the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the earth to ſwallow vp <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and ſuch like iudgments, haue ſo much horrour in them; how then can any tongue expreſſe, or heart now conceiue the horror of this day, when all the millions of wicked men ſhall be deliuered vp to thoſe eternall and remedileſſe torments? If it be ſuch a ſhame to doe penance for one fault, in one congregation, where men will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4894:195"/> pray for the offender. What a ſhame will it be when all thy faults ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered before all the whole world, without all hope of pittie or helpe?</p>
                  <p>Nor is it poſſible for them to eſcape this fearfull iudgement; the Iudge will not be vnconſtant, nor will he take reward, he will not be ouerlaid with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of buſineſſes, he will no way be corrupted in iudgement. Not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare is impoſſible, and to appeare is intolerable: here will be no reſpect of perſons, nor will the Iudge care how it be taken, nor will he be deceiued with colours and circumſtances. Hee hath tarried ſo long, hee cannot be charged with raſhneſſe, nor can there be a hiding of any particulars from him. Euery inclination, thought, deſire, word and worke, ſhall ſurely come to iudgement. And laſtly, there can be no impediment to hinder execution.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, vpon the meditation of this laſt iudgement diuers leſſons for <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> our inſtruction are inforced. Firſt, it ſhould reſtraine vncharitable iudging and cenſuring one of another for leſſe matters, eſpecially for things indifferent. <hi>Who art thou that iudgeſt another mans ſeruant? he ſtandeth or falleth to his owne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4894:196"/> maſter. Chriſt is the Lord of quicke and dead.</hi> And therefore <hi>why doeſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thy brother? or why doeſt thou deſpiſe thy brother? for we ſhall all appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> Inaſmuch as the Lord Ieſus Chriſt will iudge the ſecrets of all hearts, and giue a iuſt triall to the actions of all men, why ſhould wee foreſtall his iudgement, or in doubtfull matters<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</note> arrogate to our ſelues this honour of Chriſt? If wee could conſider that we ſhall <hi>then euery one giue accounts vnto God for himſelfe</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.12.13</note>, wee ſhould finde worke enough to doe to looke to our owne ſcore. <hi>Let vs not therefore brethren iudge one another any more.</hi> Secondly, are there any matters of difference amongſt vs? Let the Saints iudge them and end them<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 2.</note>: God will be contented to put his cauſe to them at the laſt day, <hi>(for we know the Saints ſhall iudge the world)</hi> and therefore why ſhould we refuſe their arbitration? Thirdly, it ſhould order and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſorrowes for our dead friends. <hi>Wee ſhould not ſorrow as people without hope, ſeeing we beleeue that all that ſleepe in Ieſus, God will bring with him</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 4.13.14.17.18.</note>. Wee ſhall meet together againe in that day, and afterwards liue with the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for euer. And therefore wee ſhould comfort one another with theſe words. Fourthly, this ſummons to iudgement giues a dreadfull warning and admonition to the world, <hi>euen to all men euery where to repent. Inaſmuch as God hath appointed a day wherein hee will iudge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the man whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath giuen an aſſurance in that he raiſed him from the dead</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17.32.</note>: <hi>woe will be vnto vs if that day come vpon vs vnawares,</hi> before wee haue made our peace, and humbled our ſelues before God, and by vnfained repentance turned from all our euill wayes. It is an vnſearchable compaſſion that God ſhewes, when he offers vs this mercy, that <hi>if we will iudge our ſelues we ſhall not be iudged of the Lord in that day</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34.</note>. And it will on the other ſide exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely incenſe his wrath, when hauing ſuch grace offered, wee neglect it, and death and iudgement finde our ſinnes, both vnremitted on Gods part, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented on ours. Fiftly, <hi>ſeeing all theſe things muſt be diſſolued, how ſhould it</hi> fire vs, and daily quicken our dead and drowſie ſpirits, to a conſtant care of all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>holy conuerſation and godlines</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.</note>, vnleſſe we would diſcouer our ſelues either to be Atheiſts, that mocke at the iudgement to come, or men giuen to a ſpirit of ſlumber, that in ſoule ſleepe it out, and will not conſider our latter end?</p>
                  <p>Seeing wee are all Gods ſtewards, let vs arme our ſelues as they that muſt then giue accounts of our ſtewardſhip. And ſince wee haue all receiued ſome of Gods talents and gifts in our ſeuerall places, let vs be carefull to approue our ſelues to be good ſeruants and faithfull, ſuch as can returne them with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, leſt the portion of the ſeruant that hid his maſters talents in the earth fall vpon vs. Laſtly, ſince the day of iudgement is the day of our full and finall redemption, and ſince he ſhall come as a theefe in the night, euen in the houre that we thinke not; let vs therefore watch<note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.44.</note>, and be ready, alwaies carefull and diligent, ſighing and groaning, longing and praying<note n="k" place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note> There is no ſparke of terror in this doctrine to a godly minde. For what ſhould he feare, if he either conſider the fauour of the Iudge, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the iudgement? For the Iudge is he that hath beene all this while their <hi>aduocate</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1.</note>, to plead their ſuits by making interceſſion for them. And therefore when he comes to ſit in iudgement, he cannot goe againſt his owne pleading. He is their <hi>brother,</hi> and carries a moſt brotherly affection; and will hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his owne brethren? He is their <hi>head,</hi> and hath performed all the offices
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4894:196"/> of a head vnto them, and can hee then faile them, when they haue moſt need of him? nay it is he that hath beene iudged for vs on earth, and will hee iudge againſt vs in heauen? What ſhall I ſay? He died for vs to ſhew his vndoubted loue, euen that he might redeeme vs as a peculiar people to God, and will hee faile vs in the laſt act, when he ſhould once for all accompliſh his redemption for vs? Beſides, he hath already promiſed to acquit vs in that day, and it hath beene often confirmed both in the word, and the Sacraments, and praier: he hath left many pledges of his loue with vs, and therefore it were ſhamefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe to doubt his terror. What though he be terrible to wicked men? yet by iudging in ſeueritie he hath not nor cannot loſe the goodneſſe of his owne mercy: what ſhould wee feare him iudging in his power, when wee haue felt ſaluation in his name? Beſides, the maner of the iudgement ſhall be in all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and mercy. Thou ſhalt not be wronged by falſe witneſſes, nor ſhalt thou be iudged by common fame or outward appearance: the Iudge will not be tranſported with paſſion or ſpleene, nor will hee condemne thee to ſatisfie the people: and beſides there ſhall bee nothing remembred but what good thou haſt ſought or done; and not the leaſt goodneſſe but it ſhall be found to thy honour and praiſe at that day. And if it were ſuch a fauour to a baſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect if the King ſhould take notice of him to loue him, and ſhould in an open Parliament before all the Lords and Commons make a long ſpeech in the particular praiſes of ſuch a ſubiect: what ſhall it be, when the Lord Ieſus in a greater aſſembly then euer was ſince the world ſtood, ſhal particularly declare Gods euerlaſting loue to thee, and recite the praiſes (with his owne mouth) of all that hath beene good, in thy thoughts, affections, words or workes, throughout all thy life, or in thy death? eſpecially if thou adde the ſingular glory he will then adiudge thee to, by an irreuocable ſentence. And ſo wee come to the ſecond appearance, <hi>viz.</hi> the appearance of Chriſtians in glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſhall yee alſo appeare with him in glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The glory that ſhall then be conferred vpon Chriſtians may be conſidered either in their bodies, or in their ſoules, or both.<note place="margin">The glory of Chriſtians, firſt in their bodies.</note> The glory of their bodies after the reſurrection is threefold: for firſt they ſhall be <hi>immortall,</hi> that is, in ſuch a condition, as they can neuer die againe, or returne to duſt; for <hi>this mortall then ſhall put on immortalitie</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53.</note>.

                     <note n="p" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42.43.</note>. Thirdly, they ſhall be <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> not that our bodies ſhall vaniſh into ghoſts or ſpirits, but becauſe they ſhall be at that day ſo admirably glorified and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that by the mighty working of Gods ſpirit, they ſhall bee as able to liue without ſleepe, meat, mariage, or the like, as now the Angels in heauen are: and beſides, they ſhall be ſo admirably light, and agill, and ſwift, that they ſhall be able to goe abroad with vnconceiueable ſpeed, in the aire or heauens, as now they can goe ſurely on the earth<note n="q" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44.</note>. The glory vpon the ſoule, ſhall bee the wonderfull perfection of Gods image in all the faculties of it. Then ſhall we know the ſecrets of heauen and earth. And then ſhall our memories, will, and affections be after an vnexpreſſeable manner, made conformable vnto God. The glory vpon both ſoule and body ſhall be thoſe riuers of ioyes and pleaſures for euermore. And thus ſhall the man be glorified that feareth the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this glory may ſerue for diuers vſes.

                     <note place="margin">The neceſſity of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>The generall conſideration of the whole exhortation to mortification, ſhould imprint this deeply in our hearts, that vnleſſe we doe repent of thoſe ſinnes haue been in our natures and liues, and be carefull to flee from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that are in the world, we ſhall neuer haue comfort that we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God. We ſhould bring to the particular opening of all the verſes, a mind reſolued of the generall. And to quicken vs a little the more, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this doctrine, and to enforce the care of parting with our ſins, I will briefly touch by the way ſome few reaſons, why we ſhould bee willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all counſell that might ſhew vs any courſe to get rid of ſin. Firſt, our vices are the fruits of our corrupted nature. They ariſe not from any noble or diuine inſtinct but are the effects of baſe fleſh in vs. And we ſhould carry the thoughts of it in our minds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.</note> when wee are inclined or tempted to vice: wee ſhould ſay within our ſelues, this euill proceedes not from any thing that might declare greatneſſe, or true ſpirit in a man: what is paſſion, or luſt, or couetouſneſſe, but the baſe worke of the filthy degenerated fleſh? Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our vices are the onely things that defile vs, and make vs loathſome before God and men. Tis not meane clothes, nor a deformed body, or a poore houſe, or homely fare, or any ſuch thing that makes a man truely contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: no, no, it is only <hi>ſin can defile</hi>

Thirdly, the bond and forfeiture of the law or couenant of workes lieth vpon the backe of euery man that liues in ſinne without repentance.

Laſtly, <hi>know yee not that the vnrighteous ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heauen? be not deceiued for theſe things the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of diſobedience.</hi> Now I come to the words particularly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore]</hi> This word caries this exhortation to ſomething before. If it be referred to our riſing with Chriſt, v. 1. then it notes that we can neuer haue our part in Chriſts reſurrection, till we feele the vertue of his death killing ſinne in vs. If it be referred to the meditation of heauenly things, then it notes that we can neuer ſet our affections on things that are aboue, till we haue mortified our members that are on earth. The corruption of our natures and liues are the cauſe of ſuch diſability to contemplate of, or affect heauenly things. And as any are more ſinfull they are more vnable thereunto. If the word be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the appearance of Chriſt in the former verſe, then it imports that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is of great neceſſity vnto our preparation to the laſt iudgement, and will be of great requeſt in the day of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mortifie]</hi> To mortifie is to kill, or to apply that which will make deade. The Lord workes in matters of grace,<note place="margin">God vvorkes by contraries.</note> in the iudgement of fleſh and bloud by contraries. Men muſt be poore, if they would haue a kingdom,<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3.4.</note> men muſt ſorrow if they would be comforted. Men muſt ſerue if they would be free<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.</note>. And here, men muſt die if they would liue. Gods thoughts are not as mans, but his waies are higher then mans waies, as the heauens are higher then the earth<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.10.</note>. Which may teach vs as to liue by faith, ſo not to truſt the iudgement the world or the fleſh in the things of God.</p>
                  <p>But the manifeſt doctrine from this word is this, that true repentance hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4894:198"/> in it the mortification of ſinne. And ſo it implies diuers things. Firſt, that we muſt not let ſinne alone till it die it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but we muſt kill ſinne while it might yet liue. It is no repentance to leaue ſinne when it leaueth vs: or to giue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer when we can commit it no longer. Secondly, that true repentance makes a great alteration in a man. Thirdly, that it hath in it, paine and ſorrow, men vſe not to die ordinarily without much paine, and ſure it is, ſinne hath a ſtrong heart, it is not ſoone killed: it is one thing to ſleep, another thing to die:<note place="margin">Note.</note> many men with leſſe a doe get ſinne aſleepe, that it doth not ſo ſtirre in them, but alas there muſt be more ado to get it dead, by true mortification. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, true repentance extinguiſheth the power of ſinne and the vigour of it. It makes it like a dead corps, that neither it ſtirs it ſelfe, nor will be ſtirred, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, perſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions, commandements, or ſtroaks. It is a wonderfull teſtimony of ſound mortification when we haue gotten our old corruption to this paſſe: and conſtancy in prayer and hearing, and daily confeſſion and ſorrow for ſin will bring it to be thus with vs; eſpecially if we ſtriue with God and be earneſt with ſpirituall importunity, watching the way of our owne hearts, to wound ſinne ſo ſoone as we ſee it begin to ſtirre. Yet I would not bee miſtaken, as if I meant that a Chriſtian could attaine ſuch a victory ouer ſinne, that it ſhould not be in him at all, nor that hee ſhould neuer be ſtirred with the temptations or enticements, or occaſions of euill. But my meaning is, that in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and in the moſt ſinnes a Chriſtian doth finde it ſo, and in euery ſinne his deſire and endeuour is daily to haue it ſo. And his deſire is not without ſome happy ſucceſſe, ſo as ſinne dyeth or lyeth a dying euerie day.</p>
                  <p>But heere a queſtion may ariſe:<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Did not the Apoſtle grant they were dead before, and if they were dead to the world, they were without queſtion dead to ſinne alſo, how then doth he ſpeake to them to mortifie ſinne, doth it not imply they had not beene mortified before? I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Apoſtle may well vſe this exhortation for diuers reaſons. Firſt, many of them perhaps were dead but in appearance: they profeſſed mortification but were not mortified. Secondly, it might be ſome of them had begun to vſe ſome exerciſes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, but had not finiſhed their mortification: ſure it is, and wee may ſee it by daily experience, that many being wonne by the word, and ſmitten with remorſe, haue ſometimes the pangs of ſorrow for their ſinnes, but quickly are a weary of ſeeking ſorrow in ſecret for ſinne: they giue ouer, before they haue ſoundly and ſufficiently humbled their ſoules. But may ſome one ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how long ſhould we continue our ſorrowes, or how long ſhould we iudge our ſelues in ſecret for our ſins? I anſwer, thou muſt not giue ouer thy ſorrowes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſorrovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till vvee finde foure things. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> Firſt, till the <hi>body of ſinne bee deſtroyed,</hi> that is, till that generall frame of ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be diſſolued, till I ſay thou haue ſet ſome order in thy heart and life, ſo as the moſt ſinnes thou diddſt before liue in, bee reformed. Secondly, it were expedient thou ſhouldeſt ſtill ſeeke to humble thy ſoule, till thou couldeſt get as much tenderneſſe in bewayling thy ſinnes, as thou wert wont to haue in greeuing for croſſes, till thou couldſt mourne as freſhly for <hi>piercing Gods ſonne, as for loſing thsne owne ſonne</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</note>. Thirdly, thou muſt ſorrow till thou finde the power of the moſt beloued and rooted ſinnes to bee in ſome meaſure weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and abated. Fourthly, thou doeſt not well to giue thy ſorrowes ouer, till thou finde the <hi>teſtimony of Ieſus</hi> in thy hart, that is, till God anſwer thy mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full requeſts of pardon, with ſome ioyes in the holy Ghoſt, and the deawes of heauenly refreſhings. But will ſome one ſay, muſt we lay all aſide,<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſw.</note> and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſorrow till we can finde all thoſe things? <hi>Anſ.</hi> I meane not that men ſhould neglect their callings all this while, or that they ſhould carrie an outward coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enance of ſorrowing before others, or that they ſhould all this while afflict their hearts with diſcontentment, or the like. For when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wils men to pray alwaies, hee meanes not that they ſhould doe nothing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4894:199"/> but pray; but he would haue them to keep a ſet courſe of praying euery day; and beſides, to watch to all the extraordinary occaſions or opportunities of prayer, which being done a Chriſtian may be truely ſayd to pray continually, though otherwiſe he follow his calling diligently. The like I ſay of ſorrowing alwayes. But that I may expreſſe my meaning diſtinctly, I thinke, till thou canſt attain the former things,<note place="margin">What it is to ſorrovv con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</note> thou muſt obſerue theſe rules. Firſt, thou muſt lay aſide thy recreations &amp; carnall reioycings, for this the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, when he ſaith, <hi>Let your laughter be turned into heauineſſe, and your ioy into mourning</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jame.</hi> 4.9.</note>. Secondly, thou muſt beg ſorrow at Gods hand euerie day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the times ſet apart for praier, till the Lord giue thee reſt to thy ſoule by granting the things before mentioned. Thirdly, thou muſt not neglect the times of ſpeciall faſting and humiliation, if the Lord call thereunto<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22 12.</note>. Laſtly, thou muſt vſe ſpeciall ſobrietie in the reſtraint of thy liberty in earthly things, and be watchfull to make vſe of all opportunities of ſoftning thy heart. Theſe things being obſerued, thou mayſt ſeeme vnto men not to ſorrow, and mayſt follow thy calling ſeriouſly, and yet be truely ſayd to ſorrow alwayes. Thus of the ſecond reaſon why the Apoſtle exhorts ſtill to mortification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the deareſt and humbleſt ſeruants of God, may be called vpon to mortifie their members that are on earth, though they haue truly &amp; ſoundy repented of ſinne before, by reaſon of the euils of euery day, which daily and afreſh, euen after calling, breake out in their hearts and liues: and for which they muſt ſtill renew their repentance. For their firſt repentance onely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers them from ſinnes paſt: they muſt renew their mortification, as their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are renewed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Why ſinnes are called members.</note>
                     <hi>Members]</hi> It is certaine by members on earth, the Apoſtle meanes ſinne, and that fitly. For firſt, actuall ſinnes in relation to originall ſinne, are as ſo many members that grow from it. Secondly, by a <hi>Metonimie</hi> of the ſubiect, ſinne may bee called our members, becauſe it is brought into action by the help and ſeruice of our members. Thirdly, if the Apoſtle had ſpoken to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, hee might well haue called ſinne their members, becauſe they loue ſinne as they loue their members; and therefore to take away their ſinne, is to pull out their eyes, or to cut off their hands or feet, as our Sauiour ſhewes<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>. Fourthly, ſinnes in the Coloſſians, and ſo in all the faithfull, may bee heere called members comparatiuely, with the bodie of ſinne mentioned <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, the bodie of ſinne is already caſt off &amp; deſtroyed in you by your former repentance, but yet there remaines ſome limbes of ſinne,<note place="margin">Difference betvveen ſin in the godly and in the vvicked.</note> ſome members of it, theſe reſiſt: and in this ſenſe wee may heere note a liuely difference betweene ſinne in wicked men, and ſinne in godly men. For in wicked men there is the whole bodie of ſinnes, that is, all their ſinnes, vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and vnrepented. But in godly men, the body of ſin, euen the greater number of their ſinnes, they haue abandoned: onely ſome few members of their ſins remaine, which euery day moleſt them. But before I paſſe from theſe words, two things are further to be noted. Firſt, that he ſaith, <hi>your</hi> members. Secondly, he addeth, <hi>which are on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your]</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith well, your members: for indeede properly our ſinnes are our owne, and nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which are on earth]</hi> They are alſo well ſayd to bee on earth: becauſe they are ſignes of the earthly man, and becauſe they tend only to earthly pleaſures and contentments, and becauſe men with theſe vnrepented of, are not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the generall propoſition. Now followes the catalogue of ſins to be mortified: before I enter vpon the particular conſideration of them, ſome thing may be learned from the Apoſtles order. Firſt, he teacheth men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their owne perſonall vices, &amp; then orders them for mortification of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4894:199"/> to other men: ſure it is,<note place="margin">Vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vvill be iniurious perſons.</note> that euery filthy perſon will bee an iniurious perſon: and till men repent of their luſts, and other ſuch like perſonall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they will neuer ceaſe to be iniurious to other men. And ordinarily, men that are notable for malice, or blaſphemy, that is, curſed ſpeaking, &amp; ſuch like ſinnes, as the Apoſtle after names,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they are exceeding vicious perſons other wayes. Inſtance but in ſuch as reproach Gods ſeruants: marke it both in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Countrey, who are they that raiſe and vent all ſlanders and ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, concerning ſuch as preach or profeſſe the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt in the truth and ſincerity of it: I ſay marke them particularly: for my owne part, in my little obſeruation, I haue found them alwaies, either to be Papiſts, or ſuperſtitious perſons, or drunkards, or notable whore-maſters and filthie perſons, or people guiltie of other notable crimes; indeed ſometimes their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations are not ſo commonly and publikely diſcourſed of, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are men of greater place, or elſe their vices are more couered ouer and gilded with cunning pretences: yet ſeldome fals it out, but their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is commonly knowen: and many times Gods children that are vniuſtly touched, could vpon ſufficient grounds detect ſtrange abhominations in their aduerſaries, and this was vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> vſually a ſtrong argument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that his aduerſaries were men whom he knew to be workers of iniquitie. And thus much from the order of theſe catalogues.</p>
                  <p>The ſinnes heere reckoned vp, are ſinnes either againſt the ſeuenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>viz. fornication, vncleanneſſe, inordinate affections;</hi> or againſt the tenth commandement, <hi>euill concupiſcence:</hi> or againſt the firſt commandement, <hi>couetouſneſſe, which is idolatrie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt of the ſinnes againſt the ſeuenth commandement: I might heere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, in that they are placed in the firſt, that God would haue Chriſtians to bee eſpecially carefull to preſerue their chaſtitie. For this is one thing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>in the will of God concerning our ſanctification, that wee ſhould abſtaine from fornications</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.34.</note>, and <hi>that euery one ſhould</hi> know how to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and honour. And to this end hath the Lord giuen vs ſo many precious <hi>promiſes, that wee might reſolue to cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe both of fleſh and ſpirit</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</note>: now in the handling of theſe ſins againſt the ſeuenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here mentioned, I will keep this order. Firſt, I will particularly entreat of the nature and effects of each of theſe three ſinnes, and generally make vſe of all together, and therein ſhew the remedies againſt all ſins of vncleanneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fornication]</hi> There is fornication in title only, as when Victualers were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Harlots. Secondly, there is metaphoricall kinde of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or allegoricall; ſo wicked men are ſaid to be <hi>baſtards</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note>, and the Iewes were <hi>borne of fornication</hi>

                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.</note>. Thirdly, there is ſpirituall fornication: and ſo Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is fornication, and ſo vſually tearmed, both by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the Apoſtle in the Reuelation. Laſtly, there is corporall fornication: and that ſometimes notes whoredome in the generall, and ſometimes it notes that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe that is committed actually by vnmarried perſons: and this latter kinde of filthineſſe was exceeding common among the Gentiles, in all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially where it was committed, with ſuch as profeſſed to be whores: and ſo it was an effect of that horrible blindneſſe into which the nations fell vpon their idolatrie. But I ſuppoſe it may be here taken for all adulterie and whoredome. And then I come to the reaſons which may be collected againſt this ſinne, out of ſeuerall Scriptures: and generally it is worthie the noting,<note place="margin">Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vvhore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.</note> that euer the more the world leſſens the hatefulneſſe of this ſinne, the more the holy Ghoſt aggrauates it: as here it is ſet in the forefront, that the firſt and greateſt blowes of confeſſion and praier might light vpon it. But I come to the particular reaſons againſt fornication.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It <hi>defiles a man</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.</note> worſe then any leproſie: it is filthineſſe in a high degree of hatefulneſſe.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. It is ſo hatefull, that it ought not once to be named among Chriſtians<note n="p" place="margin">

                  <p n="5">5. It brings with it horrible diſhonour. <hi>If a theefe ſteale to ſatisfie his ſoule, becauſe hee is hungry, men doe not ſo diſpiſe him: but hee that committeth adulterie with a woman is deſtitute of vnderſtanding: He ſhall finde a wound and diſhonor and his reproach ſhall neuer be put away</hi>

                     </gap>rmer vncleaneſſes. Secondly, for ſuch as would preſerue themſelues againſt them, that they might not be defiled with them. There are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall remedies for the vncleane perſon. The firſt is marriage or the right vſe of it, if it be in ſingle perſons, they muſt remember the Apoſtles words, <hi>It is better to marry thou to burne</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.</note>, and if they be married, they muſt know, that the loue of their Husbands or wiues, is the ſpeciall helpe to driue away theſe impure pollutions: for ſuch is the counſell of the holy Ghoſt in the fifth of the Prouerbes, to them that are infected with theſe vicious and predominant inclinations<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.</note>, and if they finde (as it is certaine euery vncleane perſon doth finde) want of loue to their owne husbands or wiues, then muſt they begge affection of God by daily and earneſt praier. But in the ſecond place vnclean perſons muſt know that marriage alone will not ſerue turne, but they muſt adde repentance: for lamentable experience ſhewes, that marriage without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance abates not the power of luſt. And therefore ſuch as would deliuer their ſoules from the vengeance to come due vnto them, for vncleanneſſe whether inward or outward, muſt ſeeke to God and with many prayers and teares begge pardon: they muſt be waſhed from filthineſſe by the bloud of Chriſt, and the teares of true repentance. Neither let men deceiue themſelues a little ſorrow will not ſerue turne for theſe pollutions, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle vſeth the word <hi>waſhed</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.11.</note>, to note the repentance of the Corinthians from theſe and ſuch like ſinnes. Now there can be no waſhing without water, neither will a droppe or two ſerue turne.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The ſecond ſort of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>Secondly, that thoſe that are not guilty may be preſerued againſt vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, theſe things are of great vſe and profit. Firſt, the word of God and the ſound knowledge of it, for ſaith the Lord in the ſecond of Prouerbs: If thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee: if thou calleſt after <hi>knowledge, and crieſt for vnderſtanding, if thou ſeekeſt her as ſiluer,</hi> and <hi>ſearcheſt for her as for treaſures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.1.3.4.11.12.16.17.</note> 
                     <hi>then ſhall counſell and vnderſtanding preſerue thee, and deliuer thee from the euill way and from the ſtrange woman, which flattereth with her words, and forſaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth she couenant of her God.</hi> And hereunto agreeth <hi>Dauid:</hi> for propounding this queſtion, <hi>by what meanes a young man might cleanſe his heart,</hi> hee anſwereth, <hi>by taking heed to the word</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, meditation is another great preſeruatiue: wouldſt thou remoue wickedneſſe from thy fleſh, euen all the vanities of youth? then thou muſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy creator in the daies of thy youth</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. <hi>vlt.</hi> with 12.1.</note>. Thou muſt much and often think of the Lord God that made thee, not that thou ſhouldeſt wallow in the mire of theſe ſwiniſh pollutions. Beſides it is profitable to force thy heart to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meditation of thine owne mortalitie: that the thoughts of thy death, may be a kinde of death to thy luſts: this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> implies, when he ſaith, <hi>as ſtrangers and pilgrims abſtaine from fleſhly luſts:</hi> manifeſtly importing, that if we did ſeriouſly thinke that we are here but ſtrangers and pilgrims, it would tame the violence of theſe hatefull luſts. Alſo we ſhould much ponder vpon the examples of ſuch as haue ſinned, and the Lord hath fearfully viſited them both for and in their ſinne, for all thoſe things came vnto them for <hi>enſamples and were written to admoniſh vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6.8.11.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The third preſeruatiue, is daily, earneſt and conſtant praier vnto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, And if wee feele the beginning to riſe in vs, we ſhould labour for ſpeciall ſorrowes, euen, with griefe of heart to racke and crucifie them. Luſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4894:201"/> will not vſually out of the ſoule if it get any footing, till it be fired out with confeſſion and godly ſorrow. And therefore the Apoſtle vſeth the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">
                        <desc>•••••</desc>
                     </gap> of <hi>crucifying the luſts of the fleſh</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24.</note>. And that praier is a remedie, the Apoſtles owne practiſe ſhewes, for when <hi>Satan buffeted him, he praied vnto God,</hi> and that <hi>thrice,</hi> that he might get the temptation <hi>to depart from him</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The fourth preſeruatiue, <hi>is to walke in loue,</hi> I meane Chriſtian loue to Gods children, and ſuch a loue as hath both affection, and ſocietie, and ſpirituall imployment in the furtherance of the Goſpell. When the Apoſtle would charge the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to auoid fornication and all vncleanneſſe, hee doth firſt aduiſe them, and that ſeriouſly, to walke in loue,<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.3.</note> as knowing that the exerciſe of true Chriſtian loue breeds ſuch contentment, and deſire of holineſſe, that it mightily fenceth the heart againſt all baſe luſts whatſoeuer. For they cannot ſtand together: and vſually ſuch as are withdrawne by concupiſcence, are likewiſe withdrawne from all profitable fellowſhip with Gods children.</p>
                  <p>The fift preſeruatiue, is <hi>watchfulneſſe,</hi> in the daily obſeruing of the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of luſt, and in carefulneſſe in directing the heart into Gods preſence, deuoting in our couenants and deſires our thoughts and affections to God. Thus <hi>Salomon,</hi> when be would giue direction againſt the whoriſh woman, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth, <hi>My ſonne, giue mee thy heart, and let thine eyes delight in my wayes</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.26.27. The cauſes and occaſions of luſt.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The laſt preſeruatiue is to auoid the cauſes and occaſions of luſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe. The firſt is <hi>idleneſſe.</hi> This was one of the cauſes of the deteſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of <hi>Sodome,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſhewes<note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 46.49</note>. And contrariwiſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our callings is a notable helpe to keepe out inordinate deſires, and vaine thoughts, and commonly perſons ouertaken with vncleanneſſe abound with idleneſſe. The ſecond is, <hi>fulneſſe of bread,</hi> that is, by a ſynecdoche, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in meats and drinkes, either for the meaſure or daintineſſe of them. And contrariwiſe, <hi>to beat downe our bodies</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 9.27.</note>, either by abſtinence, or ſobrietie in the vſe of the creatures, is a notable meanes to quench and abate thoſe flames if they be riſen, and to keepe them alſo from that ſpeciall aptneſſe to riſe. The third is, the high eſtimation of earthly things, and the too great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them: for this loue ſecretly brings in luſt. Thus the Apoſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> ſaies, <hi>that the loue of mony</hi> and riches, <hi>breeds noiſome luſts,</hi> which in ſhort time <hi>drowne man in perdition</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note>. The like may be ſaid of the eſtimation and too much viewing of apparell, beautie, &amp;c. The fourth is ignorance and hardneſſe of heart: for thus it was in thoſe the Apoſtle mentions in the fourth to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17.18</note>, that <hi>greedineſſe</hi> to defile themſelues with all ſorts of <hi>vncleanneſſe</hi> aroſe and increaſed in them by reaſon of the <hi>inſenſibleneſſe</hi> of the heart, and the <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and emptineſſe of their mindes. And on the other ſide, luſt cannot get ſuch a head, ſo long as any ſound meaſure of knowledge is ſtirring in the minde, or tenderneſſe remaines in the heart; luſt deſires both a darke houſe and a darke minde. The fift is <hi>euill company:</hi> and therefore the holy Ghoſt giues this rule to thoſe that would not bee enſnared with the ſtrange woman, <hi>Walke thou in the way of good men, and keepe the way of the righteous.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.20.</note> The laſt is <hi>care for the fleſh.</hi> It is the libertie men take not only to feed themſelues in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue wickednes, but alſo to plod and caſt about how to ſatisfie &amp; fulfill their luſts, that doth ſo much confirme them in the cuſtome of vncleanneſſe. And therefore the Apoſtles counſell is, <hi>take not care to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.</note>

                  <p>Thus farre of the ſinnes of the ſeuenth commandement. The ſinne againſt the tenth commandement followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euill concupiſcence.]</hi> This vice containes all ſorts of euill thoughts,<note place="margin">Hovv euill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence differs from inordinate affection.</note> and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and deſires, after any kinde of pleaſure, profit, honour, but eſpecially luſtfull inclinations or thoughts. And it differs from inordinate affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inordinate affection hath in it principally the burning of luſt and a kind of effeminateneſſe, the ſoule being ouercome and inthralled with the power
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4894:202"/> of luſt. Now I thinke this concupiſcence notes luſt as it is in inclination or euill motion, before it come to that high degree of flaming, or conſent: and it is well called <hi>euill concupiſcence,</hi> for there is a good concupiſcence, both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,<note place="margin">There is a threefold good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</note> and ciuill, and ſpirituall. Naturall, after meat, ſleepe, procreation, &amp;c. Ciuill, which is an ordinate deſire after lawfull profits and pleaſures. Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and that is a luſt for and after heauenly things. And ſo the ſpirit luſts againſt the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Now that wee may know the Apoſtle hath great reaſon to counſell men to to mortifie euill thoughts, though they neuer come to conſent, theſe reaſons may ſhew: Firſt, concupiſcence in the very inclination and firſt thoughts is a breeder, it is the mother of all ſorts of wickedneſſe, if it be not betimes killed in the conception.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14.15.</note> The Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſhewes, that concupiſcence will bee quickly <hi>enticed,</hi> yea it will <hi>entice</hi> and <hi>draw away</hi> a man, though from without it be allured with no obiect. And when it hath drawne a man aſide, it will <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,</hi> and breed with very <hi>contemplatiue pleaſures,</hi> and when it hath conceiued, and lien in the wombe of the minde, and laine there nouriſhed from time to time, vnleſſe God ſhew the greater mercy, it <hi>will bring forth,</hi> bring forth I ſay a birth of ſome notable externall euill action, and when it hath gone ſo farre, like an impudent beldame, it will egge on ſtill vnto the finiſhing of ſinne, by cuſtome in the practiſe, and ſo indeed (of it ſelfe) it will neuer leaue, till it hath brought forth (as a ſecond birth) death, and that both ſpirituall and eternall death, and ſometimes a temporall death too. Secondly, if theſe luſts goe no further then the inward man, yet ſinne may raigne euen in theſe. There may be a world of wickedneſſe in a man, though he neuer ſpeake filthy words, or commit filthy action. There is a <hi>conuerſing with the very inward luſts of the fleſh</hi>

The externall efficient cauſes, are the diuell ſnaring, and the world tempting.

The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith of thoſe <hi>dumbe &amp; greedie dogs, that they could not vnderſtand,</hi> and he giueth the reaſon: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they all looke to their owne way, euery one for his aduantage and for his owne purpoſe and profit</hi>

And it is certaine (marke it) worldly minded perſons are the moſt dull and incapable perſons in ſpirituall things, almoſt of all other ſorts of men. For though they would get a little vnderſtanding while they are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet the cares of life preſently choakes all. Secondly, couetouſneſſe <hi>pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſoule through with many a ſorrow</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.</note>. The couetous perſon is ſeldome or neuer free from one notable vexation or other.

                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 15.27.</note>. All is continually in a tumult, of haſte and hurrie, what with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4894:203"/> and what with paſſion and contention, the couetous man and his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold neuer liue at hearts eaſe and reſt.

Fourthly, it is here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that couetouſneſſe is idolatrie: it makes a man an idolater. Mammon is the idoll, and the worldling is the Prieſt that ſacrificeth to Mammon. Now the couetous man ſerues his mammon with a two-fold worſhip: for with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, he loues, deſires, delights in, and truſts in his wealth; and for his outward ſeruice, he ſpends all his time vpon his idoll, either in gathering, or keeping, or increaſing, or honoring it. Laſtly, what ſhould I number particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? <hi>Couetouſneſſe!</hi> why the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it is the root of all euils.</hi> For there is almoſt no kinde of ſinne, but the ſap of couetouſneſſe will nouriſh it. If the Lord had but the ripping vp of the heart and life of a couetous perſon, and would deſcribe his vices before vs, oh what ſwarme of all ſorts of euils could the Lord finde out? Well, let vs be aſſured of this generall, that howſoeuer couetous perſons may colour matters, yet indeed they are wonderfull vicious perſons. Neither are their ſinnes the fewer or leſſer, becauſe they diſcerne them not: for the duſt of earthly profits hath put out their eyes, they cannot ſee nor diſcerne, as was before ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But who is couetous? For all men while they crie out againſt the ſinne, denie that they are couetous. Tis rare to finde any couetous perſon that will confeſſe that he is couetous. And therefore for anſwer hereunto, it will not be amiſſe out of the word of God to ſhew the ſignes of a couetous man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſignes of a couetous man.</note>The firſt ſigne of a couetous man, is the deſire to haue the Sabboth ouer, that hee might be at his worldly affaires. A couetous man thinkes all the time ſet apart for Gods ſeruice exceeding tedious and long; and hee hath a great inward boiling of deſire to haue ſuch times and imployments paſt. The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both is wonderfull burdenſome to a worldly minde, eſpecially if he be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from worldly imploiments. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> bringeth in the couetous men of his time, ſaying thus in the diſcontentment of their hearts, <hi>When will the new Moone be gone that wee may ſell corne, and the Sabboth that wee may ſet forth wheat?</hi>
                  </p>

                        <hi>Prou</hi> 28.16. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6.</note>The ſecond ſigne of couetouſneſſe, is oppreſſion and fraud. When men to compaſſe gaine, care not how they vex and racke the poore, or ſuch as liue vnder them; or in buying or ſelling (out of greedineſſe of gaine) circumuent and pill, and defraud others, by cuſtomary lying, or falſe weights, meaſures, or ballances, or any other fraudulent courſe: this is an euill couetouſneſſe. Vſury alſo, that is, a deſire to increaſe riches by intereſt, is a palpable ſigne of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, eſpecially in theſe times, when the ſinne of vſury is ſo vniuerſally condemned: for if men were not beſotted with the loue of riches, they would not dare to liue in ſuch a damned ſinne. But I thinke all men eaſily know that Vſurers are couetous, and therefore I need not proue it.</p>
                  <p>The third ſigne of couetouſneſſe, is greedy and diſtracting care: I meane ſuch a care as deuoures a mans thoughts, that euery day will keepe poſſeſſion in a mans ſoule, and run in his minde continually, both ſleeping and waking: plodding and carking cares. And this may be diſcerned by comparing theſe cares with our care for eternall things. When we haue more care for this world then for heauen, we need goe no further, but reſolue vpon it, couetouſnes hath deceiued vs. Neither doe I meane that they only are couetous, that immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diſquiet themſelues with continuall cares for getting of treaſures and the ſuperfluities of abundance: for it is ſure that couetouſneſſe may bee in vs in a high degree, though our cares be but about things that are neceſſary, as about the things we muſt eat or put on: as the comparing of the 15. verſe of <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. with v. 21.22.<note place="margin">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4894:204"/> note that man ſhould <hi>walke</hi> on it with his feet, not <hi>dote</hi> on it with his <hi>heart</hi> Thirdly, the nature of couetouſneſſe: it will neuer be ſatisfied, and how ſhould it? For the deſire of the couetous is not naturall, but againſt nature. Naturall deſires are finite,<note place="margin">Non plus ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur cor homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis auro quàm corpus aura.</note> but vnnaturall deſires finde no end, and therefore cannot be filled with the finite things of the world. Beſides, earthly things are vaine and empty. Now the veſſell that is only full of winde is empty ſtill for all that. So is the minde of the couetous. His heart will be no more filled or ſatisfied with gold then his body with winde. Hereupon it is that a couetous man is alwaies poore, and hath not what hee hath, but hath his wealth as the priſoner hath his fetters, <hi>viz.</hi> to inthrall him. Fourthly, the nature, promiſe, and prouidence of God. He is a <hi>heauenly father</hi>

Doth he cloath the graſſe of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cut downe? and will he not cloath man? Oh the weakneſſe of our faith! Beſides, is not the Lord engaged by promiſe, <hi>neuer to leaue vs nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vs?</hi> Fiftly, the condition of the couetous: <hi>All his care cannot adde a cubit to his ſtature.</hi>

                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.33.</note> And beſides, <hi>the poore and the vſurer meet together</hi> in many things. One God made them both, one Sunne lights them both, one heauen couers them both, and one graue of earth ſhall hold them both Sixtly, the gaine of godlineſſe: it is better thrift to couet after godlineſſe, for <hi>it hath the promiſes of this life and the life to come</hi>

                  <p>The third preſeruatiue is the daily practiſe of pietie. If we would ſeeke the kingdome of God firſt, both in the firſt part of our life, and in the firſt part of euery day of our life, as well in our houſes as in Gods houſe, theſe religious duties conſtantly performed, would be a great and continuall helpe againſt worldly cares, they would cleanſe our hearts of them, and daily prepare our hearts againſt them. But how can it be otherwiſe with a man then it is? They muſt needs liue and die the drudges of the world, ſeeing they haue no more care of holy duties at home or abroad: they liue like ſwine without all care of any thing but rooting in the earth.</p>
                  <p>The fourth preſeruatiue is the due preparation for Chriſts ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. For when our Sauiour Chriſt had dehorted men from the cares of this life, he adioynes this exhortation: <hi>Let your loines be girded about, and your lights burning, and ye your ſelues like vnto them that wait for their maſter, when he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the wedding, that when he commeth and knocketh they may open vnto him immediately: bleſſed are thoſe ſeruants whom the Lord when he commeth ſhall finde waking, &amp;c.</hi> One great reaſon why couetous men doe ſo ſecurely continue in the immoderate cares for this world, is becauſe they doe ſo little thinke of death and iudgement. Whereas on the other ſide Chriſtians doe with ſome eaſe withdraw their hearts from the world, when they haue inured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to die daily by the conſtant remembrance of their latter end, and by holding faſt the euidence of faith and hope, waiting when Chriſt will call for them.</p>
                  <p>The fift preſeruatiue is to ſhun the meanes and occaſions of couetouſneſſe. And to this end it is good not to conuerſe much with couetous perſons, or to get our ſelues libertie to conceiue the hope of any long proſperitie and reſt in the world: and generally we ſhould labour to obſerue our owne hearts and other mens liues, and what we finde to be a meanes to kindle or inflame coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſires, that wee ſhould auoid, and betimes ſet againſt it, or mortifie it.

                  <p>But that wee may be yet more profitably touched with the meditation of this point, I propound ſix things concerning Gods wrath further to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Firſt, the fearfulneſſe of it. Secondly, what it is that workes or brings this wrath vpon vs. Thirdly, the ſignes to know Gods wrath. Fourthly, the meanes to pacifie it. Fiftly, the ſignes of wrath pacified. And laſtly, the vſes of all.<note place="margin">The fearfull greatneſſe of Gods vvrath ſhevved.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt. The fearfulneſſe and greatneſſe of Gods wrath or anger for ſinne may appeare three wayes. Firſt, by Scripture. Secondly, by ſimilitude.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4894:205"/> Thirdly, by example. That Gods anger for ſinne is exceeding terrible and fearfull, I will ſhew by one place of Scripture onely,<note place="margin">Firſt by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.2.3.4.5.6.</note> and that is the firſt of <hi>Nahum</hi> the Prophet: for he ſaith, <hi>God is iealous, and the Lord reuengeth, the Lord reuengeth:</hi> where the repetition ſhewes the certaintie of it, that God will be as ſure to reuenge as euer the ſinner was to ſinne. But this is more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when he ſaith, <hi>he is the Lord of anger:</hi> as if he would import that his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is his eſſence, as if he were all made of anger, and that he is the author of all the iuſt anger that is in the world. And if the drops of anger in great men haue ſuch terror in it, what is the maine Ocean of anger which is in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? And to aſſure vs yet further of the terror of his wrath, he addeth, <hi>The Lord will take vengeance on his aduerſaries;</hi> which ſignifieth that the Lord will account of impenitent ſinners as a man accounts of his worſt enemies, and therefore the Lord will ſhew his diſpleaſure to the vttermoſt of their deſerts and his iuſtice. And therefore if any doe obiect that they ſee it otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Ob. Sol.</note> for the plagues of wicked men are not ſo many nor ſo great as their ſinnes, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that, and ſaith that the Lord <hi>reſerueth wrath for his enemies:</hi> hee hath not inflicted vpon them all they ſhall haue, there is the greateſt part behinde, the full vials of his furie are not yet poured out. And if any ſhould reply,<note place="margin">Ob. Sol.</note> that they haue obſerued that wicked men haue proſpered long, and ſcaped for a great while, without any puniſhments to ſpeake of, the Prophet anſwereth that, and ſaith that <hi>the Lord is ſlow to anger,</hi> that is, hee is many times long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he manifeſts his great diſpleaſure, but <hi>he is great in power,</hi> that is, hee is of ſingular fierceneſſe and vnreſiſtableneſſe when he doth enter into iudgement, he will not faile, nor be hindered.<note place="margin">Ob. Sol.</note> And if any would hope that God would change his minde, that alſo is preuented, the Prophet auouching it confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that <hi>he will not ſurely cleere the wicked.</hi> And this is the more certaine, becauſe of the dreadfull meanes that the Lord hath to declare his anger. <hi>His way is in the whirlewinde, and in the ſtorme, and the clouds are the duſt of his feet.</hi> The meaning is, that God hath wayes to execute his iudgement, wayes I ſay that are vnreſiſtable (for who can ſtay a whirlewinde?) and terrible like the ſtorme, plagues falling thicke and threefold, like the drops of the tempeſt, and in the meanes the Lord can runne like a Giant, running fiercely and raiſing the duſt with his feet. And to this giue all the creatures witneſſe. <hi>He rebuketh the ſea, and it drieth. Baſhan is waſted, and Carmell, and the floure of Lebanon is waſted. The mountaines tremble before him, and the hils melt, and the earth is burnt at his ſight, yea the world and all that dwell therein.</hi> And therefore <hi>who can ſtand before his wrath? or who can abide the fierceneſſe of his wrath? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rockes are broken by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wrath of God (to ſhew the exquiſite, and intolerable,<note place="margin">Secondly, by ſimilitude.</note> and remedileſſe paine that wicked men feele when they beare it) is compared to a conſuming fire, and to note the infiniteneſſe of it, God himſelfe is ſaid to be <hi>a conſuming fire</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, who can th nke the anger of God not to be infinitely terrible, that can but ſeriouſly conſider theſe examples and preſidents of it? Firſt, Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probating, or fore damning of millions of men. Secondly, the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> purſued with ſuch vnconceiueable iudgements vpon him and his name.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt. Fourthly, the forlorne eſtate of the Gentiles, not looked after for many hundred yeeres. Fiftly, the Iewes (ſometimes the only people to whom the Lord drew neere) now made a curſe, and aſtoniſhment, and a hiſſing throughout the earth. Sixtly, the torments which Chriſt himſelfe endured,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4894:206"/> when he was but ſuretie for ſinners. Seuenthly, what are warres, famines, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilences, diſeaſes, ſeditions, hereſies, and the infinite moleſtations in the life of man, but ſo many euident proofes of wonderfull anger in God? Eightly, the teſtimonies of afflicted conſciences be liuely in this point. When but a drop of anger lights vpon the ſoule of man in this world, how vnable is he to ſuſtaine his ſpirit? what flouds of teares flow from his wounded heart? Laſtly, the burning of the world and the flames of hell ſhall one day make full proofe of Gods anger. And thus of the firſt point.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Hovv vvrath is brought vpon vs.</note>For the ſecond, wrath is wrought or brought vpon vs foure wayes. Firſt, the Law workes wrath: for being tranſgreſſed, it breeds diſpleaſure, pleads for iudgement, records ſinne, and preſents it in Gods ſight. Secondly, Chriſt in the miniſterie of the word applies wrath, or diſcouers Gods indignation: and ſo he is ſaid to <hi>ſmite and ſlay the wicked</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſignes of Gods anger.</note>Thirdly, concerning the ſignes of Gods anger: wee muſt vnderſtand that Gods eternall anger towards other men in particular cannot be knowne, nor his temporall anger by any ordinary way of certaintie, except it be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by reuelation, as to the Prophets or Apoſtles. For by outward things we cannot know Gods loue or hatred to particular perſons, onely Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like anger to publike ſtates may be knowne, and ſo may his priuate anger to our ſelues in ſpeciall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Signes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like anger.</note>There are three ſignes to know Gods publike anger. 1. <hi>The prediction of his Miniſters:</hi> as extraordinarily the Prophets from viſion or reuelation did foretell the iudgements to enſue. And ordinarily wrath may be knowne by the comminations of faithfull Preachers: for when vpon obſeruation of threatnings in the Law made to ſuch ſinnes as then abound, they doe with one conſent in many places with inſtance and confidence giue warning of plagues to enſue, it is time for the world to awaken: for the Lords ſecrets are with his ſeruants. And he will make good their righteous threatnings. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>The ſignes in heauen, or earth, or ſea:</hi> prodigious ſights, or ſignes in the ſunne, or moone, or commets, or ſtrange births, or the extraordinary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the ſeas, and ſuch like. Thirdly, <hi>publike plagues</hi> are both ſignes of wrath preſent, and withall they giue warning of greater wrath to come, if we doe not repent. Such are famine, warre, peſtilence, and other raging diſeaſes, the death of great Princes, and the ſudden and common death of the beſt men, theſe all foretell euill to come. As wee may know fire, ſo may we know Gods anger. Wee know fire either by the report of men worthy to be credited, or by the ſmoake, or by the flame beginning to breake out: and ſo may diſcerne Gods wrath, either by the relation of his Ambaſſadors that are faithfull men, or by the ſmoake of prodigies or wonders in heauen and earth, or elſe by the flame of iudgements already begunne. And thus of the ſignes of Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like anger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Signes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate anger.</note>The ſignes of Gods anger to a particular man are ſuch as theſe: Firſt, if a man haue not the markes of a childe of God vpon him: for whom God loues and is not angrie with, they are marked with peculiar graces as indelibly as they were marked in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> with the letter <hi>Tau</hi>

Thirdly, it there bee no effectuall working of the ſpirit of grace in the vſe of the meanes, it is a plaine ſigne of Gods anger, when a man heares the word powerfully preached, and reades, and prayes, without all affection or life, and is ſo conſtantly. For if the Lord were pleaſed, hee would ſhew himſelfe in the vſe of the meanes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4894:206"/> of communion with him. Fourthly, a man may gather ſomething by his croſſes: for if he finde <hi>a ſting</hi> in them, that God fights againſt him in them, ſo as they pierce, and vex, and diſquiet his ſoule with perplexitie, but eſpecially if hee finde his heart alſo cloſed with hardneſſe, ſo as hee doe not <hi>call when the Lord bindeth him,</hi> this is in all likelihood not onely a ſigne of wrath, but that the <hi>wrath increaſeth</hi>

To be a childe to ſinne, that is to be ruled and maſtered and led by it, to be as it were at the command of luſt and corruption, that is not in a childe of God ſtanding in vprightneſſe.

                        </gap>.</note> the word here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred diſobedience, imports vnteachableneſſe, ſuch a diſobedience as is wilfull, when a man ſinnes, and will ſinne, and will not be perſwaded either by Gods word, or Gods ſpirit, or Gods people, that would aduiſe or admoniſh him.

                  <p>Further, if wee marke the coherence, in the ſecond chapter of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, verſ. 2. compared with the firſt, wee may eaſily diſcerne that a childe of diſobedience <hi>is dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</hi> His ſoule can lie at reſt, though he be guiltie of neuer ſo many ſinnes.

But yet there is great difference betweene Gods anger towards his owne children, and that wrath that commeth vpon the children of diſobedience, and that principally in three things. Firſt, wrath comming vpon the faithfull is not eternall, but temporary and in this life only: for they are <hi>deliuered from the wrath to come</hi>

For God is ſo angry with them in this life, that his anger may continue for euer, and not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in their very death. And not only ſo, but Gods anger with his own children euen in this life is not for all their daies, but only a very ſhort time of their life. For as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>his anger endureth but a moment: weeping may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4894:208"/> for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5.</note>. And in another place he ſaith <hi>he will not alwayes chide, neither will he keepe his anger for euer</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.9.</note>. And the Lord witneſſeth by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, that he forſaketh but for a ſmall moment, he hideth his face in a little wrath, but he hath mercy with euerlaſting kindnes</hi>

                        <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8.</note>: but it is not ſo with the vngodly. Secondly, as Gods wrath differs in the continuance, ſo it differs in the meaſure: it is milder towards his children then it is towards the children of diſobedience. Which appeares to be ſo two wayes: For firſt Gods anger as it is manifeſted in outward iudgements vpon his owne people, is euer proportioned to their ſtrength: he doth not conſider what their ſinne deſerues, but what their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are able to ſuſtaine. <hi>He will not ſuffer them to be tempted aboue that which they are able, but will giue iſſue with the temptation, that they may bee able to beare it</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13</note>. And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſheweth that the Lord hath great care leſt by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer-long with his people, <hi>the ſpirit ſhould faile, and the ſoule which he hath made</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.10 14.</note>. But now with the wicked it is much otherwiſe: for the Lord neuer asks what ſtrength they haue to beare it, or how they will take it, but what ſinne they haue committed, and how they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it. Beſides, the affections of Gods children are ſweetned with many mercies: for though the Lord be angry for their ſinne, yet if they will ſeeke God, and worke righteouſneſſe, they may hold out to beare the croſſe, for the Lord will meet them in the vſe of the meanes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.5.</note> to the great eaſe and ioy of their hearts. Excellently ſpeaketh the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto the Lord, acknowledging this point, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou anſwereſt them O Lord our God, thou waſt a God that forgaueſt them, though thou tookeſt vengeance of their inuentions</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">

For if the Lord ſhew them fauour, if they repent not, it will make them more vnexcuſable, and their iudgement the heauier. Thirdly, it differs in the end: for the end of Gods wrath on his owne ſeruants is their good and ſaluation. <hi>They are iudged, that they might not periſh with the world</hi>

                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.</note>. In a word, Gods iudgements are as medicines to heale them. But on the other ſide, wicked men are <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> and all tends to the fitting of them to deſtruction. The Lord comes not to them to <hi>trie,</hi> but to <hi>conſume;</hi> not to better them, but for their vvilfull impenitencie to declare his iuſtice vpon them. All theſe their differences are notably expreſt by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in his 27. and 28. chapter: for hee ſheweth that the Lord is a carefull and wiſe husbandman; and the husbandman in nature hath this diſcretion, that he ſhould <hi>not plow all day to ſow</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 21.24.</note>: ſo is it with the Lord, he doth not continue ſtill plowing with long furrowes vpon the backes of the righteous. When he hath plowed vp the fallow ground of their hearts, he will not ſtill goe ouer them, to breake the clods that remaine: but hauing once made himſelfe a furrow, he will ſow and not plow. And for the ſecond, the Prophet ſeriouſly expoſtulateth with ſuch as ſhould any way incline to thinke that the wicked &amp; the godly were ſmitten alike. <hi>Hath he ſmitten him</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 27.7.</note>? As if he ſhould aske, hath the Lord plagued <hi>Iſrael</hi> as he plagued thoſe that were enemies vnto <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And then he ſhewes this difference, that when the Lord came to viſit <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee contended with him <hi>in meaſure,</hi> and ſmote him <hi>in his bunches:</hi> whereas when God ſmites at a wicked man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.</note> he ſmites at the root, and after many blowes he will continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4894:208"/> haue him downe. And for the leaſt difference, the Prophet ſhewes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>by this ſhall the iniquitie of Iacob be purged, and this is all fruit, to take away his ſinne</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</note>: As if he would plainely affirme, that God meant ſo to caſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the furnace, as nothing ſhould be left but the droſſe, his purpoſe was therefore to afflict him that he might medicine him againſt his ſinne.

                  <p>THeſe words containe the ſecond reaſon to inforce the mortification of vice, and it is taken from their owne experience: as if he would ſay, yee haue liued a long time in theſe corruptions and ſins, and therefore it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that you haue ſpent the time paſt in theſe luſts of the Gentiles, it is high time now to abandon them: beſides you ſhould remember the miſery you liued in by reaſon of ſinne, and from thence learne to confirme your ſelues in a conſtant courſe of reſiſting and ſtriuing againſt the occaſions and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of thoſe ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>From the coherence and the generall conſideration of the whole verſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things may be briefly noted. Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſeruations from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence.</note> that the knowledge and meditation of a mans miſery by nature is a good medicine to kill luſt and couetouſneſſe: The Apoſtle like a wiſe Phyſitian, vſeth here the counſell hereunto as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of his direction. For in that he puts them in minde of it, it ſhewes that they ſhould minde it by themſelues much more. For not only it will ſhew that theſe ſinnes did then abound, but the very thought of ſuch a wofull eſtate will beat downe &amp; kill by degrees the vitious inclinations of nature vnto ſuch ſinnes. Secondly, in that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> can beare it to be told of their ſinnes paſt, it giues vs occaſion to take notice of this for a truth: that where a man hath ſoundly repented of any ſin, he can eaſily beare it, to be touched with the remembrance of it, and with lowlineſſe doth endure the needfull diſcourſe concerning it. It is a notable teſtimonie that a man hath not truely repented of ſinne, when he is ſo impatient and vnquiet in the mention or remembrance of ſinne. If a man haue a wounded arme, while it is vncured,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the leaſt touch of it makes a man ſtart and cry out: but when it is whole, you may gripe it hard and yet he aileth nothing at all. So it is with our conſciences in matters of ſinne: They are but in a miſerable caſe that rage, and fret, and reuile when the ſinnes they haue liued in are by publike doctrine diſgraced, or threatned. But may ſome one ſay,<note place="margin">The profit of remembring our miſery by nature.</note> to what end doth the Apoſtle ſo often put them in minde of their ſinfulneſſe and miſery paſt? I anſwer, he doth it for great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For the more men thinke of their miſery by nature, the more it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to a ſenſe and admiration of Gods mercy that hath drawne them out of ſuch a wretched eſtate. Beſides it is a notable meanes to keepe a Chriſtian humble, and to make him watchfull ouer a nature that by lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath been ſo prone to ſinne: and it ſerues to ſtir vp Chriſtians to a more eager deſire and diligence in vſing the meanes to aduantage them in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace. Tis now time, to redeeme the time, that hath been ſo long loſt. And it will make a childe of God induſtrious in Gods worke, ſeeing he hath ſpent ſo much time in the ſeruice of the deuill, the world, and the fleſh. And further it helps a man to ſome meaſure of patience and meekneſſe and compaſſion, in dealing with the ſinnes of other men, conſidering that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath been <hi>vnwiſe, diſobedient, ſeruing the luſts and diuers pleaſures, &amp;c.</hi> And laſtly,<note place="margin">Hovv farre pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men may meddle vvith the former ſins of others.</note> (as was before noted) it ſerues to kill the daily luſts that may bud and ſprout out after calling.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the remembring of the ſinnes of others, we muſt know the Apoſtle had a warrant by his calling and commiſſion to rehearſe the ſins
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4894:209"/> of others. For Gods miniſters are enioyned to ſhew Gods people their ſinnes: But a like liberty is not lawfull to euery priuate man. Priuate men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members others of their eſtate paſt, if it may ſtirre them vp to thankfulneſſe, or if it may further them in humiliation for new offences, or they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort one another, leſt any be deceiued by ſinne, and ſo for preuention of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions vnto which they are by nature prone: or in ſome ſpeciall caſes to cleare Gods iuſtice againſt hard-hearted ſinners, otherwiſe it is a vile and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe to be raking into the liues of others: but eſpecially to be grating vpon the faults paſt of penitent ſinners. Where God hath pardoned, what hath man to doe to impute? And thus of the coherence and generall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the words.</p>
                  <p>This verſe containes two ſpecialties of their miſerie by nature. Firſt, their continuance in ſinne, in that he ſaith, <hi>yee walked.</hi> Secondly, their delight in ſinne, in that he ſaith, <hi>yee liued in them,</hi> that is, it was the life of your life.</p>

                     <hi>In which]</hi> That is, in which ſinnes: and ſo it teacheth vs, that we ſhould be more troubled for ſinne then for croſſes. For he doth not ſay, in which miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or iudgements, but in which ſinnes and corruptions. As any are more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, ſin is their greateſt ſorrow: and as any are more carnall they are more troubled with croſſes.</p>

And therefore the Publican that troubled himſelfe about his owne ſinne, <hi>went home more iuſtified than the other.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle here tels not of the miſery of other men, but expreſly guides them to the conſideration of their owne miſery. This ſhould teach vs without ſhifting or delay to ſearch and try our owne waies, and to grow skilfull in recounting the euils of our owne liues. The true knowledge of our ſelues, is a great ſtep in a holy life. Tis that the moſt of vs neuer attaine to. And yet it is of ſingular vſe; it would make vs humble in our ſelues, compaſſionate towards others, eaſie to be admoniſhed, tender-hearted in Gods worſhip, more apt to godly ſorrow, and of great ripeneſſe and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of knowledge in caſes of conſcience.</p>

And on the other ſide, they are in a wofull eſtate that haue their corruptions growing vpon them both for power and number, and continuance.

Yea, they carry themſelues, as if they had found out a life of excellency and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment aboue all other men: and yet are buried in the ditches of monſtrous wickednes, and are deſcending ſwiftly to their owne place, haſting to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to come. Many times the holieſt men are moſt penſiue, and the vileſt men, moſt liuely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liued]</hi> There is a fourefold life of men.<note place="margin">A fourefold life.</note> The life of nature, the life of corruption, the life of grace, and the life of glory. The firſt life <hi>Adam</hi> liued before his fall. The laſt, the bleſſed liue in heauen. The third, the godly liue after their conuerſion on earth: and the ſecond, is the life of all the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Sin is aliue: It hath a liuing being in the vnconuerted ſinner: It is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ingendred in the heart of man, by coniunction with Sathan, ſeating his ſeuerall limbs in the ſeuerall faculties of the ſoule. Now it will not be amiſſe to conſider how we may know when this monſter is aliue, &amp; when he is dead. Sinne may be knowne to be aliue,<note place="margin">How we may know when ſinne is aliue,</note> firſt by the flaming deſires of the heart and thoughts of the minde, inordinately bent vpon things forbidden.

Thirdly, by the contentment men place in knowne euils. Fourthly, by cuſtomarie practiſe. And laſtly, if this monſter by the deceitfull working of Sathan ſhould liue ſtill for a time, (as many times it doth euen in the worſt men) yet there is a way to try whether it be a-liue or no. For bring it to the law, and it will preſently reuiue. If it be pricked and pierced with the terrors and reproofes of a ſound application, it will ſhew it ſelfe, by vnquietneſſe, and vnruly diſtempers.

Secondly, if the command ouer the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſoule be ceaſed. Thirdly, if a man ſeeke and place his chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in ſpirituall things. Fourthly, if the cuſtomarie practiſe of euill be broken off and diſſolued: and laſtly, if the heart will abide the ſearching and ſound application of the law.</p>

                     <hi>In them]</hi> So wretchedly is the vnregenerate heart of man compoſed, that he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4894:210"/> doth not only liue and ſinne, but he liues in ſinne, and with ſinne, and by ſinne too. He <hi>liues in ſinne,</hi> becauſe he is drowned vnder the power and guilt of ſinne. He <hi>liues with ſinne,</hi> becauſe he is not a gueſt onely, but a ſoiourner alſo with his ſinne. Sinne keeps the houſe, and the ſinne is at bed and boord there. And he <hi>liues by ſinne too,</hi> for moſt ſinners cannot contriue how to liue without them. The letcher cannot liue without his miſtris, &amp; the vſurer cannot liue without his gaine, and ſo of the reſt. All theſe are woefull circumſtances of euill, and doe marueilouſly decipher out a ſoule that feeles not the life of Ieſus Chriſt in him, and they impart alſo a further miſery. It is eaſie to commit ſinne, but it is not eaſie to be rid of ſinne; a man may alſo quickly forget his ſinne, but he ſhall not ſo quickly forgoe his ſinne; for howſoeuer by Gods ſingular pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he liues, for all his ſinne, yet by the ſingular wretchedneſſe of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all his ſinnes will liue with him, they are not tranſient, but ſo long as he liues, his ſinne will liue with him; yea it will goe with him too when he dies, if it be not preuented with ſpeedy repentance.</p>
                  <p>The vſe alſo of all this may be to teach conuerted Chriſtians, that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from this wofull miſery, <hi>to walke as children of the light: hauing their fruit in all goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe and truth: hauing no further fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darknes,</hi> ſeeing all is now <hi>made manifeſt by the light</hi>

The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> meanes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when he ſaith of the Lord, <hi>he will ſubdue our iniquities,</hi> and then after ſaith, <hi>he will caſt them away into the depths of the ſea</hi>

If we marke the true catalogue of ſinnes, which here followeth, it ſhewes that we muſt forſake all ſorts of ſinnes aſwell as one: For we muſt forſake and put away inward ſinnes aſwell as outward, for he ſaith, <hi>put away anger and wrath:</hi> we muſt put away leſſer ſinnes aſwell as greater, for he ſaith, put away filthy ſpeaking, aſwell as before he had ſaid, mortifie fornication and vncleanneſſe.

He that will continue any longer in ſinnes that bring him no profit nor pleaſure, and ſuch euils as he hath power to leaue if he will, if theſe be not giuen abſolutely ouer, it is to no purpoſe for a man to talke of repentance. 4. Particular ſinnes that a man hath greatly loued, they are put away by ſerious and diſtinct labour in praier, and ſenſible ſorrow and griefe of heart for them: For leſſe then this will not ſuffice for particular beloued ſinnes. Now laſtly, there will remaine certaine remnants of ſome ſins, that haue rootes in our corrupted diſpoſitions, euen after the firſt repentance. Now theſe are ſaid in Gods acceptation to be put away, when a man prayes againſt them, and mournes ouer them, and daily iudgeth himſelfe for them: and ſo they may be in his nature, &amp; yet be truly, though not perfitly put away. And thus of the generall charge. The catalogue followes. And the ſinnes are either ſinnes of the heart, or ſinnes of the tongue. The ſinnes of the heart are <hi>anger, wrath, malice.</hi> The ſinnes of the tongue are, blaſpheming or curſed ſpeaking, filthy ſpeaking, and lying. Firſt of the ſinnes of the heart.</p>

                     <hi>Anger, wrath,]</hi> I ſuppoſe theſe words expreſſe one and the ſame ſinne: it may be the two words import two degrees of anger.

                  <p>Anger may be conſidered, 1. as indifferent. 2. as laudable. 3. as a vice.

For all pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is not euill, but vniuſt perturbation onely: for Chriſt was angry and vexed, and grieuouſly troubled, as at the death of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and yet he was without ſinne.</p>

I ſay, it is a godly paſſion. For there are two ſorts of naturall paſſions: Some are ſo euill, they can neuer be good, as enuie. Some are ſo naturall, as they may be either good or euill as they agree or diſagree with the law of God, and ſuch is anger. I ſay <hi>iuſt zeale,</hi> for I know that euery zeale hath not alwaies either good cauſe or good effect. I adde <hi>againſt ſinne,</hi> becauſe it muſt not be our indignation at the perſon.

                  <p>Now concerning vicious anger, I propound two things principally to be conſidered. 1. <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 2. <hi>Remedies againſt it.</hi> Now for the firſt, There are diuers things might perſwade a Chriſtian to make conſcience of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of anger and frowardneſſe. 1. <hi>The commandement of God,</hi> which is expreſſe, <hi>Be not haſtie in thy ſpirit to be angry,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> recordeth it in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.11.</note>. 2. The praiſes the Lord giues to men that can bridle their anger, and the diſgraces the Holy Ghoſt caſts vpon impatient perſons, as <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 14.29. <hi>He that is ſlow to wrath is of great vnderſtanding: but he that is haſtie of ſpirit exalteth folly.</hi> And againe, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 19.11. <hi>It is the diſcretion of a man to deferre his anger, it is his glory to paſſe ouer a tranſgreſſion.</hi> And againe, <hi>Prou.</hi> 12.8. <hi>A man ſhall be commended according to his wiſdome, but he that is of a peruerſe heart ſhall be deſpiſed.</hi> And in the place of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> before alleaged, he ſaith, <hi>Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.</hi> 3. <hi>The nature of euill anger.</hi> What is anger, but the furie of the vncleane ſpirit, the madneſſe of the ſoule, the vnreſt of all faculties, a very beaſt within the heart of man? 4. <hi>The effects of anger:</hi> Which may be conſidered, either more generally, or more particularly. And the particular euill effects are either internall, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. The internall effects are ſuch as theſe: 1. It blindes the minde, the iuſt anger troubles the minde, but vniuſt anger blindes it. 2. <hi>It looſeth the bowels of pitty and mercy,</hi> eſpecially from the perſons. A man hath no affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neither for duties of piety, nor of mercy. 3. <hi>It grieues the ſpirit of God</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30, 31.</note>. 4. <hi>It lets in the Diuell into a mans heart</hi>

                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17.</note>. The externall effects are theſe: 1. <hi>It will interrupt prayer,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, if there be froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through indiſcretion or contempt in the familie, that will interrupt prayer, and worke a negligence in Gods worſhip<note n="n" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</note>. And therefore it is one thing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſely requires wee ſhould looke to concerning praier, namely, <hi>That men pray as without doubting, ſo without wrath</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</note>. 2. It is a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4894:212"/> great hinderance to the profit of hearing, and therefore it is one of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> his rules, that if we would profit by the word, we ſhould be <hi>ſlow to wrath</hi>

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſables a man for ſociety: for it is Gods commandment, or aduiſe, that we ſhould <hi>make no friendſhip with an angry man, nor goe with a furious man:</hi> and as for other reaſons, <hi>leſt we learne his wayes, and receiue deſtruction to our owne ſoules</hi>

                  <p>The remedies againſt anger are of two ſorts. 1. there are remedies for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our ſelues. 2. there are remedies for anger in others.</p>
                  <p>There are diuers things are good to repreſſe and ſubdue and mortifie anger in our ſelues. 1. From the coherence of theſe words with the former verſe, it appeares, that the ſerious and frequent meditation of our miſery, is a good meanes to cut downe the power and vnrulineſſe of our paſſions. 2. Sauing knowledge will make a man <hi>peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intreated</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17.</note>; and the true reaſon why there is ſo much paſſion many times in the heart, is, becauſe there is ſo litle knowledge in the head: for paſſion and folly are twins. Thirdly, to preuent anger, or to reſtraine it, it is good to take heede of <hi>medling with the ſtrife that belongs not to vs,</hi> but carefully to minde and meddle with our owne buſineſſe<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 26.7.</note>, eſpecially we ſhould take heede of medling with fooliſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet perſons, for <hi>he that contendeth with the fooliſh, whether he rage or laugh there is no reſt</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.9.</note>. Fourthly, we muſt not <hi>giue place to wrath</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi>, nor let it haue a vent by ſudden, and vnaduiſed words, or by ſuffering our affections to increaſe in ſwelling and deſire of reuenge: we ſhould ſilence our paſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to ſuſpect and reſtraine our words. Anger ſmothered will languiſh, but let out will flame vnto further miſchiefe. Fifthly, we ſhould diuert the courſe of our anger, and ſpend the heat of our affections vpon our owne ſinnes, and it were good to get into our heads a catalogue of ſome of our chiefeſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if we be ſuddenly tempted to anger, we might preſently thinke of thoſe ſinnes, and ſpend our zeale vpon them. Sixtly, we ſhould conſider him that prouokes vs to anger; that he is the inſtrument of God to try our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and that if he doe it wilfully it is a brand of his folly. Laſtly, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the paſſion of Chriſt is an excellent remedy to kill anger and to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie it. And thus of anger in our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Now the remedies for anger in others are ſuch as theſe. Firſt, ſilence.

                  <p>And the firſt reaſon may be taken from the vile nature of it. It is a vice ſo tranſcendent, that it paſſeth other vices; it hath been vſually ſaid, that to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry is humane, but to perſeuere in anger (which is this malice) is deuiliſh: and therefore it is reckoned in the firſt to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> amongſt the monſtrous ſinnes, which the monſtrous Gentiles fell into: beſides, to <hi>hate and be hatefull,</hi> is a dangerous ſigne of vnregeneracie<note n="f" place="margin">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4894:213"/> praiſe-worthy qualities were in a man before: and it is a great let both to the word and prayer; and thence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts, that if wee would grow by the word in affection and practiſe, we muſt then <hi>lay aſide all malice and enuy</hi>

Firſt, we muſt take heede of the cauſes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and they are either within vs or without vs; within vs there is pride<note n="ſ" place="margin">

Thirdly, much malice and grudge would be auoided, if we did but obſerue that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.17. namely, that when we did conceiue diſlike of any thing in our brother, for which we did feare we ſhould hate him, we ſhould go to him, and reproue him, <hi>rebuking him plainely for his ſinne:</hi> many times a ſeaſonable reproofe drawes out the poyſon of beginning grudge and malice.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4894:213"/> euen vpon the croſſe great wrongs, &amp; worſer enemies: we ſhould lay a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie vpon our ſelues, to be aduiſed before we would admit contention, or the reſolution to contend, for as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>by pride commeth contention, but with the well-aduiſed is wiſdome</hi>

Finally, it is curſed ſpeaking when men ſpeake euill of any man, and there is a ſpeciall kinde of it in ſpeaking euill of godly men, and this properly is blaſphemie in the ſecond table, for the Lord for the honor he beares to his people, is pleaſed to afford the name of blaſphemie to their reproches, as importing, that he takes it as if he were reproched himſelfe.</p>

And therefore the Apoſtle in the fifth to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> alſo, aſwell as here puts it into the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of euils he would moſt ſeriouſly diſſwade them from: and out of that Chapter, we may gather diuers reaſons againſt it. 1. Wee are deare vnto God and therefore ſhould follow him as deare children. Now of all things we neuer ſaw any colour of this in God. Angrie ſpeaking indeede is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for our capacity giuen to God: but neuer filthy ſpeaking, or any the leaſt glimſpe of it. 2. Our loue ſhould bee as Chriſts was. Now his was to profit not to infect, and it was pleaſing to God, not hated, as this filth of wordes muſt needes be. 3. It is a ſhame, and vncomlineſſe, and diſhonour to a Chriſtian. 4. If any would obiect it is but a ſmall matter, the Apoſtle would ſoone anſwer, men ought not to be deceiued with vaine words for it is ſure that becauſe of this and ſuch like things <hi>commeth the wrath of God vpon the children of diſobedience.</hi> 5. This is a froth of filthineſſe that ſhould onely be found in vnregenerate men that lie in darkneſſe, and it is a worke of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſpeake filthily aſwell as to doe filthily. 6. If we be children of the light we ſhould ſhew it by our fearefulneſſe to ſpeake or doe any thing that were vnpleaſing to God. And we ſhould ſhew it by reproouing ſuch filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in others: for ſuch filth if it be not reproued is not regarded, but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reproofe will make manifeſt in ſome meaſure that it is not good nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to truth and righteouſnes, and goodnes. 7. Men are in ſome degree of a Lethargie that vſe this ſin. 8. A Chriſtian ought to walk exactly, ſtrictly, preciſely or circumſpectly, it is no more then he is bound to do, to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the leaſt filthy word aſwell as of filthy actions, and therein to take notice of Gods will.

                     </note>. Before I paſſe from this vice, there are certaine queſtions<note n="a" place="margin">Queſt.</note> to be anſwered,<note n="a" place="margin">Anſw.</note> as firſt whether all lying be ſinne or no. That this may be vnderſtood men vſe to diuide lies into three ſorts. There is an <hi>officious,</hi> and a <hi>pernicious,</hi> and a <hi>ieſting</hi> lye. All men condemne the pernicious lie, many excuſe the lie in ieſt, and ſome commend the officious lie, but the truth is, all are naught. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>lie not at all,</hi> for he ſpeaketh indefinitely. But it will be obiected that the <hi>midwiues</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Micholl</hi> did lie, but it muſt be anſwered, that their zeale and piety was to be praiſed,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but the meanes they vſed was not to be imitated. If any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that the Patriarches vſed lying, they muſt know that diuers ſpeeches of theirs, which to ſome ſeeme to bee lyes, indeed were not. For <hi>Sarah</hi> was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſiſter, and <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>Iſaacks</hi> firſt borne by diuine diſpenſation and prophetically, and ſo <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech about the high Prieſt may be excuſed, when he ſaith he <hi>knew not that he was the high Prieſt.</hi> For from the death of Chriſt the right of the Prieſthood ceaſed.

                  <p>In theſe words is heedfully to be noted, the matter to be auoided: both the old man and his workes. 2. The maner imploied in the metaphor <hi>(put off)</hi> with the time, <hi>haue,</hi> and the perſons, <hi>yee.</hi>

                  <p>The old man is by ſome taken to be their old condition of life in the time of Idolatrie; by others, to be their cuſtome and habit in ſinne:<note place="margin">vvhat the old man ſignifieth</note> but it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the moſt taken to be the <hi>corruption of nature,</hi> and <hi>inborne prauitie,</hi> that vicious humor and ill diſpoſition that naturally is in euery one of vs, it is the image of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>This corruption is here ſaid to be, <hi>the man:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is called the man.</note> becauſe it is ſeated in euery part of man, and becauſe it rules and frames a man, and becauſe it liues in man, ſo as ſinne only ſeemes to be aliue and the man dead, and becauſe God will take
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4894:216"/> notice of nothing in the ſinner, but his ſinne.</p>

Alſo in ſome men, ſinne may be ſaid to be old in reſpect of continuance, this is moſt fearefull; age in any corruption is a moſt grieuous circumſtance of aggrauation; it is beſt not to ſinne at all, and the next, to get quickly out of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What are the works of the old man.</note>Thus of his nature: now of his workes. The workes of the old man are in generall, workes of darkneſſe, of iniquitie, of the fleſh, vaine, vnfruitfull, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, abhominable, deceiuable, ſhamefull, and tend to death. And now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, if we would know what he doth, and how he is imployed, wee muſt vnderſtand, that he giues lawes to the members againſt the law of God and the minde; that hee frames obiections and lets againſt all holy duties; that he ſtriues to bring the ſoule into bondage and captiuitie vnder imperious luſts; that he inflames the deſires of the heart againſt the ſpirit: that he infects our vaine generation, and workes both ſinne and wrath for our poſteritie; but more eſpecially, his workes are either inward or outward: inwardly he works Atheiſme, impatience, contempt, carnall confidence, hypocriſie: he forges and frames continually, and multiplies euill thoughts: he workes luſts of all ſorts, he workes anger, rage, malice, griefe, euill ſuſpitions, and the like. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, he workes all ſorts of diſorders, impieties, vnrighteouſneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance. A catalogue of his outward workes are ſet downe, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.23.</note>. He is here in the coherence, deſcribed to be couetous, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, wrathfull, curſed, and lying: and all theſe are well called his workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he reſts not in euill diſpoſitions, but will burſt out into action: beſides, it is his trade to ſin, and they are well called his workes, becauſe they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a mans own, for till a man repent he hath nothing his owne but his ſin, and it is to be obſerued that his works indefinitely muſt be put away: as if the holy Ghoſt would imply, that all his workes were nought: for his beſt workes are infected with the viciouſnes of his perſon, or elſe they are not warranted in the word, or they are not finiſhed, or the end was not good, or the manner not good, or they were wrought too late, or being out of Chriſt, they were not preſented by Chriſt vnto God, in whom onely they can be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the matter to be reformed, the manner followes. <hi>Put off]</hi> The faithfull are ſaid to put off the old man ſix waies. 1. <hi>In ſignification,</hi> or ſacramentally, and ſo in baptiſme. 2. <hi>In profeſſion,</hi> or outward acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo we profeſſe to leaue off the practiſe of ſinne. 3. <hi>By iuſtification.</hi> and ſo the guilt of ſinne is put off. 4. <hi>By relation,</hi> and ſo in our head Chriſt Ieſus he is euery way already perfectly put off. 5. <hi>By Hope,</hi> and ſo we beleeue he ſhall be wholy remooued at the laſt day. 6. <hi>By Sanctification,</hi> and ſo he is put off but in part, and inchoatiuely: the laſt way is here principally meant.</p>
                  <p>Now in reſpect of Sanctification, the old man and his works are put away, firſt, in the word, for ſo Chriſtians are ſaid to <hi>be cleane by the word</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3.</note>. And to <hi>be ſanctified by the word</hi>

                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17.</note>. The word, <hi>firſt,</hi> begins the worke of reformation, it informes, renues, chaſeth away the affections and luſts of ſinne, &amp;c. And then ſecondly, the Chriſtian at home puts him away by confeſſion, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, and the diuorce of daily practiſe of reformation. This is in effect
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4894:216"/> that which is ſignified in the other metaphor, of <hi>crucifying the old man</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6.</note>: for to crucifie him, is to lift him vp on the croſſe of Chriſt, and to naile him with the application of Gods threatnings, which cauſeth the paines of godly ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haue] Q.</hi> Can men put off the old man in this life. <hi>Anſw.</hi> They may by inchoation not perfectly. <hi>Q.</hi> But when may wee haue the comfort of it, that the old man is put off and crucified in vs. <hi>Anſ.</hi> When he is ſo ſubdued that he raignes not, for (to take the benefit of the word, crucified) to crucifie is not abſolutely and outright to kill: and therefore it is ſaid in the Creede, Chriſt was dead, after he had ſaid, he was crucified, to note a further degree. Now then, (as I conceiue of it) ſinne is crucified, when we make our natures ſmart for it, ſo repenting of our ſinne, as we allow no ſinne: for to crucifie a man, is to leaue no member free: prouided that we be ſure, that the old man be ſo pierced, that he will die of it, though he be not preſently dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yee]</hi> The perſons are indefinitely ſet down, to note that it is a duty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all ſorts of men, to put off the old man, and this worke it is required of great men, of learned men, of wiſe men, of young men, in a word, of all men without exception.

                  <p>And firſt we may here informe our ſelues concerning the neceſſitie of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, there is in vs ſuch corruption of nature, and ſuch works of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they be not mortified, they will certainely mortifie vs. Secondly, here may be collected, matter of confutation, and that of Popiſh antiquity: for euery man carries that about with him, that may prooue that a thing may be ancient and yet vile. Thirdly, how can the moſt of vs eſcape, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes of God muſt needs fall vpon vs, for euery man looks to the mending of his houſe, and his lands, and his apparell, &amp;c. but who lookes to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his nature? euery man hath courage to put away an euill ſeruant, and an adulterous wife, but where are the people that will reſolutely ſet vpon the diuorce of ſinne? men may be deceiued, but the truth of God will remaine vnchangeable, if we haue not put off the old man with his deceiueable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and workes, we haue not after all this hearing <hi>learned Chriſt as the truth is in him</hi>

                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24.</note>. He was created in it. And then falling from God by ſinne, hee recouers the renuing of the Image of God, by grace and effectuall calling in Ieſus Chriſt, that this may bee more fully vnderſtood, we muſt know that man is the Image of God, either conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more ſtrictly as a ſuperiour, or more generally as man. As a Superiour man is ſaid to be Gods Image in Scripture two waies chiefly, 1. As a husband and ſo in the familie the Apoſtle calls him, the Image <hi>and glory of God</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7.</note>. 2. As a Magiſtrate, and ſo Princes and Rulers are called gods<note n="t" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.</note> on earth, but neither of theſe are meant here. For this Image of God here mentioned, is that likeneſſe of God, which by the ſpirit of grace is wrought in euery one of the faithfull after their calling.</p>
                  <p>Howſoeuer the perfit vnderſtanding of Gods Image, belongs to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and to the viſion of heauen, yet in ſome meaſure we may conceiue of it, as it is reuealed in the word, and imprinted in the nature and obedience of man. Two things I principally propound to he here conſidered more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, 1. Wherein man is the Image of God. 2. The differences of the Image of God in man, either from that which is in Chriſt, and the Angels, or as it is to be conſidered in the ſeuerall eſtates of man, and then I come to the vſe of all.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, man is ſaid to beare the ſimilitude of God, or to haue in or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4894:218"/> vpon him the Image of God in 5. reſpects. Firſt, in that in conceiuing of God man begets a kind of Image in his minde. For whatſoeuer we thinke of, there ariſeth in the minde ſome likeneſſe of it, now if wee conceiue of God amiſſe, then we commit horrible Idolatrie, and whatſoeuer ſeruice is done to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we ſo conceiue off is done to an Idoll. But now when Chriſtians taught out of the word, conceiue of God according to the deſcriptions of the word, that is not after the likeneſſe of any creature, but in a way of apprehending of God in the humane nature of Chriſt, or otherwiſe according to his nature or properties, in ſome true meaſure, this Idaea or forme of God, as I may ſo call it, in the minde of the faithfull is a kinde of the Image of God. For to conceiue a likeneſſe of God is not vnlawfull, but to conceiue him to bee like any creature in heauen and earth that is prohibited and vnlawfull. Secondly Man is after the Image of God in his ſubſtance, and therefore we are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſaid to be <hi>Gods ofspring</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28.</note>. Now man is Gods Image both in his ſoule and in his body. The ſoule is the Image of God, as it is ſpirituall and ſimple, and as it is inuiſible, and as it is immortal, and as it is an vnderſtanding eſſence hauing power to know all ſort of things, and to will freely. And ſome thinke it is Gods Image as there is in it a purtraiture as it were of the Trinity, for as there is in God diſtinct perſons and yet euery perſon hath the whole eſſence, ſo there is in the ſoule diſtinct faculties, and yet euery facultie hath in it the whole ſoule, yea is the whole ſoule. Now that the body alſo is Gods Image theſe reaſons may proue. 1. Man is ſaid to be made after Gods Image in the firſt creation. Man I ſay, not the ſoule of Man onely. 2. Gods Image was in Chriſts body: for he ſaith, <hi>hee that ſeeth me ſeeth the Father.</hi> He ſaith not hee that ſeeth my ſoule, nor indeed could the ſoule be ſeene. 3. When the Lord prohibiteth the ſhedding of mans bloud, he yeeldeth this reaſon, for in the Image of God made he man, now it is manifeſt the ſoule cannot be killed, therefore mans body is after Gods Image. Now that God hath any body, but in three reſpects. 1. As mans body is a little world, and ſo the example of the world which was in God from all eternity, is as it were briefly and ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily expreſt by God in mans body. 2. There is none of our members almoſt but they are attributed to God in Scripture, and ſo there is a double vſe of our members, the one that they might ſerue the offices of the ſoule, and the other that they might be as it were certaine types or reſemblances of ſome of the perfections of God. 3. Becauſe the gifts of the minde do cauſe the body to ſhine as the candle doth the horne in the lanthorne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, man is after Gods Image in the qualities of the ſoule: ſuch as are wiſedome, loue, zeale, patience, meekneſſe, and the reſt: for in theſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth in ſome manner thoſe glorious and bleſſed attributes of God. 4. Man is after Gods Image, in reſpect of ſanctity of actions, in that hee is holy as he is holy, and in that he reſembleth God in his workes, as in louing and hating where God loues and hates, and in knowing and approuing of things as God approues or knowes of them, it is plaine man reſembles God in louing and ſhewing kindneſſe to his enemies<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> but generally by holineſſe of cariage man doth reſemble God, I meane in the creation did ſo, and by grace the faithfull beginne to do ſo. Laſtly man beares the Image of God in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty of dominion, and that both ouer himſelfe and as he is Gods vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent ouer the liuing creatures and the earth, and thus of the firſt point.</p>
                  <p>Now for the differences of Gods Image, firſt that Image of God in man and the Image of God in Chriſt differs in two things. 1. Chriſt was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Image of the father, as he was God, and we are his image but by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. 2. Chriſt as man by reaſon of the perſonall vnion is filled with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite perfections aboue meaſure which are in no man elſe beſides.</p>
                  <p>Againe it differs from the Image of God in Angels in three reſpects. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4894:219"/> they excell in nature, for they are wholy ſpirituall, and in action, they performe Gods will with greater glory and power. 2. They are free from all humane neceſſities euer ſince their creation. 3. They enioy the viſion of glory in the preſence of glory in heauen, in a manner peculiar to their place and natures.</p>
                  <p>Now for the differences of the image of God in man according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eſtates of man, we muſt know the image of God according to the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold eſtate of man, is likewiſe threefold. 1. There is the <hi>image of nature,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had. 2. The <hi>Image of grace,</hi> which the Saints now haue. And thirdly, the <hi>Image of glory,</hi> which the bleſſed haue in heauen.</p>
                  <p>The Image of God in Adam had diſtinct ſpecialties, Adam was a perfect Diuine, and a perfect Philoſopher, euen in an inſtant, he knew the nature of all things in the inſtant of his creation, which now is attained vnto with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame labour, and ſingular weakneſſe. 2. He had an immortall nature, free from infirmities, diſeaſes, death. 3. Hee ſhould haue propagated an immortall ſeed, after the image of God, whereas now grace will not be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. 4. His obedience was charged with the obſeruation of the tree of life and of good and euill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note>The image of grace hath theſe ſpecialties; 1. Faith. 2. Godly ſorrow. 3. The cohabitation of the fleſh. 4. A feebleneſſe and defect in the meaſure of grace. 5. A peculiar kinde of inhabitation of the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the image of glory hath theſe differences; a freedome like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from all terrene neceſſities. 2. An vtter aboliſhing of the ſinfull fleſh, and of the very naturall diſpoſition to die. 3. A full perfection of all graces. 4. A loſſe of faith and ſorrow, and all the works of repentance. 5. A ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnutterable communion with God and good Angels in glory.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this doctrine of Gods image, ſhould ſerue, to teach vs to loue and admire all that feare God, ſince the Lord hath graced them with this honour to be like God: it is a greater fauour, then if they had reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the nobleſt Princes that euer were on earth, no all the carnall men on earth in all their glory, cannot reach to that abſoluteneſſe of excellencie, that is in one of the pooreſt of Gods ſeruants. 2. Since the ſeat of this glorious reſemblance of God is in the heart, it ſhould teach vs eſpecially to looke to our hearts, and <hi>keepe them with all diligence</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.</note>, euen to be conſcionably carefull to ſee to it, what thoughts and affections are lodged there: the deuill deſires no more aduantage, then to haue libertie to erect in the heart houlds for euill thoughts and ſenſuall deſires. 3. If it ſhould be our glory to be faſhioned after the image of God, then it condemnes the abhominable ſecuritie of the moſt men, that are ſo mindleſſe of the repaire of the loſſe of this diuine gift, and in ſteed thereof with ſo much care <hi>faſhion themſelues after this world</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</note>, or after the <hi>luſts of their owne</hi> and old <hi>Ignorance</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14.</note>, or after the wills and humors of men<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2.</note>. 3. How are we bound vnto God for this vnſearchable loue, that is pleaſed to reſtore vnto vs this diuine gift through the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus in generall of Gods image.</p>
                  <p>But before I paſſe from theſe words, there is further to be conſidered, firſt, the forme of ſpeech, in that he ſaith not, his Image, but <hi>after his Image.</hi> 2. The efficient cauſe, noted in thoſe words, <hi>of him that created him.</hi> For the firſt, wee muſt vnderſtand, that to ſay, <hi>man is the Image of God,</hi> and man <hi>is after the image of God,</hi>

                  <p>THis Verſe may containe an other reaſon to perſwade to mortification and holy life. And the reaſon may be taken from the great reſpect God hath of true grace in Chriſt, and the little loue or care he hath for any thing elſe, a Barbarian, a Scythian, a bond-man, if he haue grace ſhall be accepted: wheras a Graecian, a Iew, a free-man, without grace, is without reſpect with God, Chriſt is all. It may be the Apoſtle here meets with the falſe Apoſtles, that ſo much vrged the obſeruation of Iewiſh rites, &amp; ſtand ſo much vpon it to diuert the people from the ſound care of reformation of life, by filling their heads with queſtions and vaine wrangling about the law, whereas the Apoſtle ſhewes men may be abſolute and compleat in theſe outward obſeruances, and yet their circumciſion auailes them nothing before God.

                     <note place="margin">The diuiſion of this part of the text.</note>THere are three things requiſite to holy life. Firſt, the meditation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things. Secondly, the mortification of vice. Thirdly, the exerciſe of holy graces and duties. Of the firſt the Apoſtle hath intreated from verſe 1. to verſe 5. Of the ſecond from verſe the 5. hitherto. Now in theſe words, and thoſe that follow to the 18. verſe hee intreats of the third, for he giues rules for the obedience of the new man, and thoſe rules are more ſpeciall, or more generall. The more ſpeciall rules are from the 11. verſe to the ſixteenth. The more generall rules are in the 16. &amp; 17. ver: the one concerning the means of holy life, v. 16. and the other concerning the end of holy life, v. 17.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall rules giue in charge the exerciſe of nine graces, and in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of theſe rules I obſerue. 1. The Motiues to perſwade to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of them, and they are three; the one taken from their election, the other from their ſanctification; the third from the loue of God to them. And theſe are briefly thruſt together in a parentheſis in the beginning of the twelfth verſe. 2. The manner how they be charged with theſe graces, &amp; that is noted in the Metaphor <hi>put on.</hi> 3. The graces themſelues, and they are in number nine. Some of them haue their greateſt praiſe in proſperitie princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, as <hi>mercy kindneſſe, meeknes, humbleneſſe of minde,</hi> ſome of them concerne the times of aduerſitie principally, as <hi>long-ſuffering and clemencie in forbearing and forgiuing.</hi> Some indifferently belong to all times, as <hi>loue, peace, thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or amiableneſſe,</hi> ver. 14.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Obſeruation from cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>Now from the coherence imported in the word <hi>(therefore)</hi> diuers things may be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that he preſcribes the mortification of vices, before the exerciſe of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it ſhewes that till vice be mortified, grace will not grow nor proſper, the true reaſon why many men thriue no better in the gift of Gods ſpirit, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo little and ſo ſleightly in confeſſing and bewailing of their corruptions of heart and life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he reſts not in the reformation of vices, but preſcribes alſo rules of new obedience, it ſhewes that it is not enough to leaue ſinne, but wee muſt be exerciſed in doing good. It will not ſerue turne for the husbandman, that his fruit trees beare no euill fruit, but hee will cut them downe if they bring not forth good fruit, barrenneſſe is cauſe great enough of hewing downe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men that are truely renued after the Image of Chriſt are willing to bee appointed and preſcribed, for the attaining and exerciſe of euery holy need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grace and dutie, he that hath true experience of the beginning of any true grace, hath a true deſire, and a willing endeauour, and a iuſt eſtimation of all grace. For as he that repents of one ſinne loues no ſin, ſo he that trauels in the birth of any grace deſires all grace, ſo farre as in conſcience he knowes them to be required of God, and in ſome degree, except it be in the time of violent temptations, or that the loſſe of the meanes occaſion any deadneſſe or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the deſires of the heart, or that there be a relapſe into ſome preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſinne after calling.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this <hi>(therefore)</hi> carry vs to the former verſe, then we are informed, that our indeauour after mercy, meekneſſe, patience, loue, peace or the reſt, will neuer want acceptation with God. And withall wee may take comfort if we
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4894:221"/> would ſeriouſly ſet about the practiſe of theſe, though wee found many lets, and doubts, and difficulties, yet Chriſt will be all in all to help vs, and giue good ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the coherence. The motiues follow, and firſt of Election.<note place="margin">Of Election. Two kinds of Election.</note>

                  <p>Thus of the firſt Motiue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Holie]</hi> They are holy diuers waies; For they are holy, 1. in the <hi>head.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Holineſſe is eſſentiall to a childe of God, Gods elect are holy, this is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where proued in Scripture<note n="m" place="margin">

                     </note>, we ſee they are here ioyned and we muſt not ſeparate them; But may ſome one ſay, ſeeing no man is without his thouſands of ſinnes, and infirmities, what muſt wee doe that we may haue comfort, that we are holy in Gods account,<note place="margin">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4894:222"/> he hath otherwiſe many infirmities, yet he is holy in Gods account, yea in the holineſſe of ſanctification. The firſt is this, if a man can ſo farre forth ſubdue his corruptions, that <hi>ſinne raignes not</hi> in him; ſo long as it is in him but as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, it doth not fruſtrate his comfort in his ſanctification. 2. If a mans prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, deſires, and indeauors be <hi>to reſpect all Gods commandements</hi> as well as one; Iuſtice as well as Piety, holy times as well as holy things, inward obedience as well as outward, ſecret obedience as well as open, auoyding leſſer ſinnes as well as greater. 3. If a man be ſincere in the vſe of the meanes that make a man holy, preparing his heart to ſeeke God in them, eſteeme them as his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed food, mourning for want of ſucceſſe deſired, endeauouring to profit by euery ordinance of God, and that at all times as well as ſometimes, at home as well as at Church. Laſtly if a man can finde comfort in the pardon of his ſinnes, he needs not doubt of his acceptation to be holy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fiue proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods loue.</note>
                     <hi>Beloued]</hi> In this word is lodged the third Motiue, which is taken from Gods loue, as if the Apoſtle would affirme that if Chriſtians did ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it is to be loued of God, they would finde full incouragement to all grace and dutie: now this may be better opened, if wee conſider but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Gods loue, wherein it wonderfully excels. As firſt, if God loue thee it is with a <hi>free loue,</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5.</note> he ſtands not vpon thy deſert or worthineſſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he <hi>loues firſt,</hi> hee loues before he be loued, he loued vs when wee hated him, he choſe vs when we did not chuſe him. 3. Gods loue is wonderfull <hi>tender,</hi> which will appeare if wee conſider that he is not onely <hi>gracious,</hi> but <hi>mercifull, ſlow to anger,</hi> of <hi>much kindneſſe,</hi> and <hi>repenteth him of the euill</hi>

                        <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.13.</note>. 4. Gods loue is <hi>naturall,</hi> not forced, and therefore he is ſaid to <hi>quiet himſelfe in his loue</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17.</note>, and himſelfe <hi>loueth mercy</hi>

                        <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18.</note>. Laſtly, his loue is an <hi>euerlaſting loue</hi>

And therefore we ſhould labour to know the loue of God to our ſelues, euen to be particularly aſſured that we are Gods beloued or elſe this could not be a motiue to holineſſe, as here it is. And beſides the meditation of Gods loue to vs ſhould incourage vs againſt all croſſes, for God will <hi>giue his beloued reſt</hi>

But eſpecially it ſhould hearten vs againſt the ſcornes of the world, and the hate of wicked men: if God loue vs, it mattereth not greatly who hate vs: And in ſpeciall, the meditation of this loue of God ſhould teach vs to tyre our ſelues with theſe worthy graces, as ſo many ornaments; for thus ſhould the beloued of God be decked. And doth the Lord loue vs, and ſhall not we ſtriue to ſhew our loue to him againe? Euen by louing his word, glory, children, preſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Laſtly; we may here learne how to loue: for God loues, Firſt thoſe that are holy. Secondly, thoſe whom he had choſen: ſo it ſhould bee with vs; firſt we ſhould chuſe for holineſſe, and then loue for our choice. This may teach the people how to loue their Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and ſo wiues and ſeruants. And contrariwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the motiues, the manner followes.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Put on]</hi> viz. as men doe their garments, it is true that theſe graces for the worth of them are royall, and ſo muſt be put on as the King doth his crowne, or the Prince elected his robes, it is alſo true that for ſafety theſe graces are as armour to defend vs againſt the allurements of the world, or the reproches of euill men, and ſo may be put on as the ſouldier doth his armor. Beſides theſe graces are required in vs as the ornaments of a renued eſtate, and ſo are to be put on as the new baptized was ſaid to put on his new garments. But I thinke the metaphor is taken generally from the putting on of rayment.</p>
                  <p>Diuers things may be here noted. 1. It is apparant that theſe graces are not naturall, the ſhadowes and pictures of them may be in naturall men. And what wicked men can get is but by the reſtraining ſpirit, or by reaſon of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4894:222"/> defect, or for ill ends. It is certaine a man may be ſaid to be borne,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as well with clothes on his backe, as with grace in his heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How ſhould the hearts of many ſmite them, to thinke of it, how they <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſeru. </seg>2</label> neglect this clothing of their ſoules with graces: They euery day remember to put on apparell on their backes, but ſcarce any day thinke of putting on vertue for their hearts? Oh when thou ſeeſt thy naked body clothed, ſhouldſt thou not remember that thy ſoule in it ſelfe more naked then thy body, had need of clothing alſo? Oh the iudgement that abides many a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how exceſſiuely carefull are they to trimme the body, and yet are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely careleſſe of trimming their ſoules, that haue ſo many gownes for their backes, that they haue neuer a grace for their hearts: yea the better ſort may be humbled if they ſearch their hearts ſeriouſly: for either they want di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parcels of this holy raiment, or elſe they are not well fitted on them, they hang ſo looſe many times, there is little comelineſſe or warmth by their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe graces. But let vs all be inſtructed to remember theſe graces, and by praier and practiſe to exerciſe our ſelues in them, and daily to be aſſaying how we can put them on, till by conſtant vſe of all good meanes, we can grow ſpiritually skilfull in wearing of them, and expreſſing the power of them in conuerſation, as plainely as we ſhew the garments on our backes, reſoluing that theſe vertues will be our beſt ornaments, and that they are beſt clad that are clothed with theſe godly graces in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the manner, the enumeration of the graces follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bowels of mercy.]</hi> From the Coherence I note two things concerning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Firſt that it is not naturall, we are exhorted to put it on, naturally wee are hatefull and hate one another<note n="a" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may note here that mercy is as it were the doore of vertue. It ſtands here in the forefront, and leades in and out all the reſt, it lets in humilitie, meekneſſe, patience, &amp;c.</p>

Spirituall mercies are not all of a ſort, for wee may ſhew mercy ſometimes in things wherein no man can help, as by praying vnto God for helpe: now in things wherein man can helpe, the mercy to be ſhewed reſpects either the ignorance or other diſtreſſes of other men. The mercy to the ignorant is either <hi>inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the things they ſhould know, or <hi>councell</hi> in the things they ſhould do.

                  <p n="2">2. The conſideration of the doctrine of mercy may ſerue for the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the want of mercy in men, and that monſtrous vnmercifulnes that euery where abounds amongſt men, we may complaine that <hi>mercifull men are periſhed,</hi> or if mercy get into the hearts of ſome it is like the <hi>morning dew,</hi> it is quickly dried vp. But the world is full of vſurie and crueltie, and oppreſſion, the world hath almoſt as many wild beaſts &amp; monſters, as it hath Land-lords in diuers places. And ſhall nothing be ſaid thinke we in the day of Chriſt to

                  <p>Thirdly, this doctrine is exceeding comfortable too, for here is implied great comfort to all Gods children, for if God require ſuch tender mercy in me, he will certainely ſhew mercy himſelfe. And againe, poore men may be much incouraged to conſider how carefull God is of them, and how much mercy he requires to be ſhewed them; yea it is a comfort to them if they bee godly poore, that there being ſo many kinds of mercy, they may ſhew mercy themſelues, euen to their richeſt benefactors, by ſpirituall mercy.

Nor is it complementall curteſie, for wee ſee that may be in greater exactneſſe in men, and yet monſtrous pride and malice belodged in mens hearts. Nor is it any counterfet ſubmiſſiueneſſe, as when ſome men ſcorne to refuſe offices, and yet fret afterward when they go without them, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of purpoſe to be the more importuned. Nor is it humbleneſſe of mind to be (with fretting) complaining of our wants, out of emulation of others; nor is it onely to be humbled, for humiliation and humilitie differ.</p>
                  <p>Now that the nature of this grace may be found out, we muſt conſider that vſually it is begotten in a man by the power of the word, and followes the breaking of the heart by mortification, and declares it ſelfe both inwardly and outwardly.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Long ſuffering]</hi> By Long-ſuffering is meant, as I take it, Firſt, an vnwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried firmeneſſe of heart, holding out vnder all croſſes, tentations, oppoſitions &amp;c. The minde not being eaſily broken, put out, confounded, diſcouraged, diſtempered, or vnquieted with any kind of paſſion. And ſo indeede it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the perſeuerance of patience. Secondly, there is a long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which is a ſpirituall perſeuerance of hope, vnder the promiſe, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the performance of it<note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12.15</note>. There is a long-ſuffering in our carriage toward others, in regard of their reformation, and ſo we ſhould ſuffer long in hope of the conuerſion of the wicked<note n="ſ" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.25.</note>: and in expecting the reformation of infirmities in Gods children, whom wee loue and admoniſh<note n="t" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14.</note>.

                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>The long-ſuffering is an excellent grace and a worthy ornament, meet to be put on, aſwell as any of the reſt, and would wonderfully grace the liues of Chriſtians. And the rather ſhould wee loue it, and long after it, becauſe it is ſo eminent a praiſe in God himſelfe,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>THere are two vertues in conuerſing that concerne aduerſitie. 1. Long-ſuffering vnder croſſes, and clemencie vnder iniuries.</p>
                  <p>Of Long-ſuffering before. 1. Of Clemencie in this verſe, where two things may be noted: 1. the duty required: 2. the reaſon rendred for the vrging of the dutie. The duty is propounded in the two principall parts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to forbeare, and to forgiue; and amplified by the ſuppoſition of a caſe, <hi>If any man haue a quarrell to another.</hi> The reaſon is from the example of Chriſt forgiuing vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forbearing]</hi> The originall word is rendred ſometimes to maintaine,<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 18.14.</note> ſometimes to ſuffer, to endure<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22.</note>, ſometimes not onely to endure, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare alſo<note n="c" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</note>, ſometimes to ſupport<note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. What it is to forbeare.</note>. In the two laſt ſenſes it may be well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here.</p>
                  <p>Now if wee would diſtinctly know what it is to forbeare one another, as it here imports a maine part of Chriſtian clemencie; we muſt vnderſtand, that it is not an omiſſion of holy duties to others, nor a refuſing to ſatisfie others in their griefes or offences, nor a ſhunning of their company, nor yet a ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of all ſorts of iniuries, committed with an high hand, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement or ſatisfaction. But out of clemencie to forbeare others, hath in it ſuch things as theſe. 1. A freedome from the thirſt of reuenge. 2. A bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the infirmities of others, which may be performed two waies; Firſt, by couering them, and not blazing them abroad, if they be ſecret. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by ſilence, in not reprouing them when they faile meerely in frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thirdly, it hath in it not onely a bearing with them, but a bearing of them,<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2.</note> and that I thinke may be two waies alſo. Firſt, in not ſtirring or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking their infirmities. Secondly, by pleaſing our neighbours humour in that which is good to edification<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1.2.</note>. Fourthly, there is a forbearance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of wrong to vs, and thus to forbeare, is not to proſecute euery wrong, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by anſwers or by ſuits. And this forbearance is to be practiſed, when we are able to reuenge, elſe it is no thankes to vs to forbeare, when we want either power or oportunitie to doe it. 2. Tis forbearance not to meete wrong with wrong.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, there is a threefold forbearance: Firſt, in iudgement, when in doubtfull caſes wee ſuſpend our opinions or cenſures. Secondly, in words which conſiſt either in not anſwering, or in giuing ſoft anſwers. Thirdly, in deedes when we render not euill for euill.</p>
                  <p>Againe, forbearance is varied from the conſideration of time, for in ſome things we muſt forbeare euer, neuer taking notice of the infirmities or wrongs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4894:225"/> as in ſome weakeneſſe that are by meere ouerſight, or ignorance, and in ſome things we muſt for beare for a time, that is, till there bee a fit opportunitie to admoniſh or correct, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration thereof ſerues greatly for the reproofe of that wretched diſtemper in many that profeſſe the ſame faith and hope,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</note> prouoking one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and conſuming one another, and by frowardneſſe, diſquieting the reſt and content of others. Is it not heere an expreſſe charge that wee ſhould forbeare one another? Haue we not heere the example of Chriſt who did ſo,<note place="margin">Motiues.</note> who might haue had a thouſand fold more iuſt reaſon to vpbraid, cenſure, or finde fault, then we haue, or can haue. Beſides this diſtempered peeuiſhnes, and froward miſconceiuing and cenſuring, it is bred of ill cauſes, for it comes either of malice or ignorance. Of malice, for loue couereth a multitude of ſins, eſpecially it ſuſpendeth doubtfull actions. Of ignorance, for it is certaine a wiſe man will keepe in till afterwards, or hold it his glory to be able to paſſe by an offence. Further, this ſinne may be aggrauated by the relations that are mutually betweene Chriſtians. Are they not fellow-members, coheires, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, partakers of the ſame afflictions, are they not brethren, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is not this alſo a conſtant iuſtice, that they that iudge, are iudged; they that cenſure, are cenſured; and doth not this enuying, and iangling, giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of reioycing to aduerſaries? Doth it not many times ſo transforme Chriſtians, that it makes them very like wicked men, when they grow ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered that they reuile their owne mothers ſonnes<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.9.10.11 12.13.15.</note>? In the fifth to the <hi>Galathians</hi> the Apoſtle vrgeth this reproofe by diuers reaſons, ſuch as this. A little of the leauen of theſe diſtempers, will ſowre the whole lumpe: and thoſe courſes tend not to any good, but to the diſquieting of Gods people, and it is not a ſmall matter to trouble and vexe them. Beſides inaſmuch as Chriſtians haue trouble enough otherwaies, it doth not become their brethren to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them: and we ſhould be ſo farre from troubling our brethren, as we ſhould rather ſerue them by loue, and if men will needes bite one another, let them take heede leſt they be deuoured one of another. Laſtly, if men will not be warned, then let them know the Iudge ſtandeth at the doore<note n="i" place="margin">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4894:226"/> Chriſt forgaue, ſo muſt he; wee muſt remember the diſtinctions of Chriſts actions, ſome were miraculous, as faſting 40 daies, raiſing the dead,  theſe are not to be imitated, becauſe they cannot: ſome are peculiar actions belonging to his office, as to redeeme, or make interceſſion, &amp;c. theſe alſo are proper to him onely: Now ſome are morall, theſe laſt are only imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Or thus, ſome actions of Chriſt he did as God, ſome as Mediator, ſome as man. The laſt onely binde vs to follow.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in that we are bound to forgiue, as he forgaue,<note place="margin">To forgiue as Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue hath ſix things in it.</note> it not onely teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we muſt doe it as well as he: but for the manner of it as he did. And how was that? Firſt, Chriſt forgaue his inferiors. Secondly, Chriſt forgaue great faults aſwell as leſſe, yea all ſorts of faults, yea though they were often fallen into. Thirdly, nothing was too deare to Chriſt to merit or confirme his forgiueneſſe, therefore he ſhed his owne bloud, he ſtood not vpon his profit, or his eaſe. Fourthly, Chriſt vſes all meanes to preuent offending. Fifthly, where Chriſt forgiues he forgets. Sixthly, Chriſt forgiues two waies. Firſt, vpon the Croſſe before men did repent. Secondly, by the Goſpell, publiſhing his pardon vpon mans repentance, he did not carry them grudge till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented: and all theſe wayes ſhould we imitate Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, obſerue here the certainty of aſſurance: For if a man did not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and infallibly know, that Chriſt did forgiue him, how could that be made a reaſon, if he did not know it to be.</p>
                  <p>And thus of clemencie, and ſo of the two firſt ſorts of graces.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4894:227"/> rare in the world, for man is vnto man naturally a wolfe, a fox, a beare, a tygre, a lion, yea a very deuill; and that is the reaſon why men are ſo conſtant in malice, it is naturall with them, and this is the reaſon why vnitie and louing concord is found in no calling amongſt men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loue]</hi> Loue is of diuers kindes, there is naturall, ciuill, morall, and religious loue: It is naturall loue for a man to loue himſelfe, his parents, kinred, &amp;c. Tis ciuill loue that is framed in vs by the lawes of men, by authoritie from God, whereby we are brought not to violate the rules of iuſtice, or ſociety: In morall loue, that loue of friends is of eminent reſpect; but it is religious or Chriſtian loue is meant here.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtian loue is caried both towards God and towards men, and both may be here meant: For the very loue of God may be required as needfull in our conuerſing with men, becauſe we can neuer loue men aright, till we firſt loue God; and beſides we are bound in our cariage, to ſhew our loue to God, by zeale for his glory, and auoyding ſinne in our callings, for the loue we beare to him.</p>
                  <p>Sure it is that the true loue of God is exceeding needfull to be put on, as a moſt royall robe; I ſay the true loue of God, and therefore I aduiſe all ſorts of men as to labour for it, ſo to try themſelues whether this loue of God be right in them; if we loue God, we receiue them that come in his name<note n="b" place="margin">

And this loue will compell vs to holineſſe<note n="e" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</note>, cauſing vs to hate what he hates, and to obey his commandements<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <p>The loue to men is loue of enemies, or brotherly loue of Gods children; Chriſtians are bound to loue their very enemies, and this kind of loue muſt be put on as well as the other, onely let vs aduiſedly conſider what the loue of enemies hath in it. When God requires vs to loue our enemies, he doth not require vs to loue their vices, or to hold needleſſe ſociety with their perſons, or to further them in ſuch kindneſſes as might make them more wicked, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the defence of our iuſt cauſe; but to loue is not to returne euill for euill,<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The bond of perfection]</hi> Loue is ſaid to be the bond of perfection three waies. 1. Becauſe it is a moſt perfect bond, and ſo it is an <hi>Hebraiſme;</hi> for all vertues are not as it were collected in loue, all other vertues will ſoone be vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4894:227"/> vnleſſe they be faſtned in loue; neither doth it only tye vertues together, but it giues them their perfection, mouing them, and perfecting them, and making them accepted. And it is moſt perfect, becauſe it is moſt principall among vertues, nothing is in this life well compoſed that is not directed hither.</p>
                  <p>But let none miſtake, he doth not ſhew here how we be made perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but how we might conuerſe perfectly amongſt men. And ſo the ſumme of this ſenſe is, that all ſhould be well with vs, in liuing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if loue flouriſh amongſt vs, perfection conſiſteth in loue by way of bond.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a bond of perfection, becauſe it is the bond that ties toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, which is the beauty and perfection of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a bond of perfection as it leads vs to God who is perfection it ſelfe; yea by loue God is ioyned to man, and dwels in him.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of all is, ſeeing loue is of this nature, vſe, dignitie, and perfection,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> therefore we ſhould labour to be rooted in loue, euen euery way firmely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it. And to this end we ſhould labour more to mortifie our owne ſelfe-loue, and the care for our owne eaſe, profit, credit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this may wonderfully alſo ſhame vs for thoſe defects are found in vs. It may greatly reproue in vs that coldneſſe of affection that is euen in the better ſort, and thoſe frequent ianglings and diſcords, and that fearefull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of fellowſhip in the Goſpell in many places, and all thoſe euill fruits that ariſe from the want of the exerciſe of this grace, ſuch as are ſuſpitions, blinde cenſures, &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Let it rule]</hi> The originall word is a terme borrowed from running at race, and it imports; Let peace be the iudge, let it ſit and ouer-ſee, and moderate all the affections of the heart, ſeeing we are in a continuall ſtrife, whereas our affections would carry vs to contentions, diſcords, brawlings, grudges, and diuiſions, &amp;c. Let the victory be in the power of peace. Let peace giue the applauſe, and finally determine the matter.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the explication of the ſenſe of the words.</p>

                  <p>Now all theſe words may be firſt vnderſtood of internall peace with God, and then God may be ſaid to be the author of it in diues reſpects.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Hovv peace is of God.</note>1. It may be ſaid to be of God, becauſe he ſent his Sonne to merit it. Hence Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>our peace</hi>

                  <p>Now this peace of God is ſaid to rule,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when it ouerſwayes doubts and tentations, eſtabliſhing the heart in the confidence of the aſſurance of Gods loue in Chriſt, which is when a man can ſay as the Apoſtle did, <hi>I am perſwaded neither principalities nor powers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heights nor depths, things preſent nor things to come, ſhall euer be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus. Catharinus</hi> a very Papiſt could gather certainty out of this place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when in our cariage we continually feare to offend God, or doe any thing that might diſturbe the peace of our conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when in aduerſitie we can denie our ſelues, and rather chuſe to ſuffer affliction then forgoe the peace of Chriſt in our hearts<note n="n" place="margin">

                  <p>Now when the Holy Ghoſt adds <hi>in your hearts,</hi> it implies that true peace with God will encounter both preſumption, and hypocriſie, and diffidence: <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> for it will rule in our hearts, it will not abide hardnes of heart, and the ſpirituall ſlumber: It will not reſt till there be affections of godlineſſe, as well as common profeſſion of it. <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> for it notes that it will not rule onely by keeping iuſtice in a mans life, but it will rule within a mans thoughts and affections.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus of internall peace, externall peace followes: And it is either dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, or eccleſiaſticall, or politicall. Peace ſhould rule our houſes, and ſhew it ſelfe by freedome from bitterneſſe, and chiding, and brawling, and abſurd peeuiſh paſſions.</p>
                  <p>And for Church peace (to write a word or two of that) it is not onely a reſt from perſecution, but alſo from diſcords within, this is a marueilous bleſſing. This peace hath not in it a confuſion of all ſorts of men, ioyned together in one vniuerſall amitie, though they be neuer ſo wicked: For <hi>Chriſt came not to ſend ſuch peace,</hi> and the word is a fanne that will make a diuiſion. The world will hate, and darknes will not mix with light, the children of the Prophets will be <hi>as ſignes and wonders euen in Iſrael.</hi> But this peace is a holy amitie and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly concord, in the true members of the myſticall bodie, both in conſent and doctrine. This peace in the Church is of ſingular worth, and occaſions vnſpeakeable ioy and growth in the Church: this is to be ſought and prayed for of euery Chriſtian, but eſpecially it ſhould be the care of Church-gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. And certainely there would be more peace if they would more and more loue goodnes, and honour good men, and more carefully preuent and ſeuerely purge out the leauen of corrupt doctrine, and wicked life, and ſo tithe <hi>minte</hi> and <hi>cummin,</hi> as not to neglect the weightier things of the law, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they would more diſgrace flatterers and ſlanderers, that imploy their whole might to make the breach worſe.</p>
                  <p>Politicall peace is either priuate, and ſo it is a reſt from ſuites and quarrels: Or publike, and ſo it is a reſt from warres, and rebellions, and tumults.</p>
                  <p>But I thinke by externall peace here is meant in generall, concord, and a quiet, harmeleſſe, peaceable courſe of conuerſing with men in all our cariage. Now God is ſaid to be the author of it, in that it is his gift, and ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to worke it amongſt men; and it is ſaid to rule when we can preferre publike peace before our priuate reſpects; and when we can ſeeke it, and not ſtay till it be ſought of vs; and when we can forbeare and forgiue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any inequalitie. Now this peace may be ſaid to rule in the heart, though it be externall, becauſe if corrupt paſſions be killed in thee, (as enuie, rage, malice, deſire of reuenge, &amp;c.) men would eaſily agree in life; binde the heart to the good abearing, and the hands will binde themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The vſe may be both for reproofe of the peruerſe diſpoſitions of the moſt men that will not liue in peace, but with all falſhood and ſinne, nouriſh debate and vaine contentions: as alſo it may informe and inflame men to deſire peace, to ſeeke it, yea to follow after it<note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the which yee are called]</hi> We are called to peace not onely by men, who by their lawes require peace, but chiefly by God, and that two wayes. Firſt, in the generall precepts of the words which are ſet downe in diuers places. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ſpeciall manner, in the word of reconciliation, that word that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts vs and reconciles vs, doth at the very firſt ſhew vs the very neceſſitie and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4894:229"/> worth of peace; as the ſenſe of our neede of Gods mercy, makes vs merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to men; ſo the ſenſe of our neede of peace with God, makes vs peaceable with men.</p>
                  <p>This confutes their folly, that ſay forwardneſſe in religion makes men tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent; moſt wretchedly do prophane men ſinne againſt Gods people in that aſperſion: for they are called to peace, and are the moſt peaceable people in the world. But let all that feare God, euen ſhew the fruit of their holy calling, by approuing themſelues to be louers of peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In one bodie]</hi> The ſecond reaſon is taken from their mutuall relation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, they are members of one body, and as it is vnnaturall and vnſeemely to ſee a man teare his owne fleſh, ſo it is moſt vnnaturall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely for Chriſtians to bite and deuoure one another, by iarring, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning, and wrangling one with another: and we ſhould hence learne to ſpeake all one thing, and haue all one faith, and one heart, and ſo liue in peace that the God of loue and peace may be with vs. But of this myſticall vnion in the former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thus of Peace. Thankfulneſſe followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And be yee thankefull]</hi> Thankfulneſſe is either to God or men. Tis the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here is meant: Thankfulneſſe to men muſt be conſidered in it ſelfe, and in the amiable performance of it, for the word is by ſome rendred amiable. And it may be it notes but the right manner of affecting in giuing or receiuing thankes.</p>
                  <p>This thankfulnes hath in it principally gratitude, that is, thanks in words, yet it may containe alſo gratuities, that is, tokens of good will, whereby we indeuour indeed to recompence good for good.</p>
                  <p>Thankfulnes is ſometimes in deſire, ſometimes indeede; it is true thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnfainedly to deſire opportunitie to ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>Thankfulnes may be due, not onely to godly men, but alſo to wicked men; yea ſuch as turne to be our enemies, we ſhould watch to the opportunities of doing them good, though they be euill.</p>
                  <p>Now the Amiableneſſe required, is either in him that muſt performe thankfulnes, or in him that muſt receiue it.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, diſtreſſed men, as well as ſuch as liue at eaſe, and proſperitie, and abound in leiſure: I ſay, ſuch as haue many cares and troubles, diſtreſſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by croſſes<note n="h" place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, ignorant men, as well as learned men, ſuch as are ſimple in reſpect of naturall parts, or vntaught in reſpect of education, are tyed aſwell as others; they may not ſay, they were not brought vp to learning, for many times ſimple and vnlearned people in the very <hi>entrance into the word</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4894:231"/> Yea,<note place="margin">Women muſt ſeeke knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as vvell as men.</note> ſuch women as are full of buſineſſe and cares, not good women or wiues, but good huſwiues alſo are tied, yea not onely to learne the word, but to teach it as the places ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the perſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>in you,</hi> notes the place that the word muſt be entertained in: <hi>In you,</hi> that is, in your mindes, for contemplation; in your hearts for holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and affections; in your conſciences to guide them to a holy manner of giuing ſentence, &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dwell]</hi> A metaphor borrowed from houſhold entertainment, and notes three things vnto vs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the word ſhould be familiar to vs, and knowne of vs readily, and we ſo acquainted with it, as with our brethren, or ſiſters: <hi>Say vnto wiſdome, thou art my ſister, &amp;c. Pro</hi> 7.4: To note, that as in nature he is accounted a ſingular idiot that knowes not his owne brothers or ſiſters; So in religion, in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is extreame ſimplicitie, and blindneſſe, not to be familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the grounds of behauiour and comfort, as they are contained in the word.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in our houſes.</note>2. That it ſhould be domeſticall, we muſt get it into our houſes, aſwell as our Churches, and that three waies: Firſt, when we come home from God, houſe we ſhould keepe the word taught a foote by repetitions of it, and by tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it vpon all occaſions, that the life of doctrine be not loſt. Secondly, there is required a familiar teaching, and plaine and familiar inſtructing of ſeruants, diſtilling of the principles, and profitable precepts of the law as they are able. <hi>God gaue his teſtimonies to Iſrael,</hi> not that the Clergy men ſhould haue them in the Temple and Synagogue, but that Parents ſhould haue them in their ſeuerall dwellings, <hi>to inſtruct their children, and their childrens children</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5, 6 <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.</note>. Thirdly, the admonitions, rebukes, counſels, and incouragements vſed in the familie ſhould be grounded on the word: for conſcience onely is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all right ſubiection, and obedience: the bonds of nature (becauſe he came out of thy loines) or the bonds of policie (becauſe he is thy hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant) are too weake to inforce (of themſelues) a conſtant, and cheerefull, and iuſt ſubiection. The true reaſon why men ſpeed ſo ill in their ſeruants and children is becauſe they nurture them with their owne words, but diſtill not into their conſciences the words of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be not intimated ſufficiently before: yet plainely vnderſtand, that the word is to be exerciſed in our houſes; Firſt, as a refuge againſt afflict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, as a meanes of inſtruction to our ignorant children and ſeruants. Thirdly, as a meanes of the ſanctification of the creatures, and our callings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. Laſtly, ſeeing Satan will tempt vs, and our natures will be vicious, not onely in Gods houſe, but in our owne houſes, we haue reaſon to carry the medicine to the ſore, and to bring the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, home with vs, and draw it there, ſeeing the Deuill will caſt his fiery darts there. He that is in danger of a ſubtle &amp; furious enemie, alwaies muſt looke vnto two things: Firſt, that he hath on all his armour: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he be ready at all times, in all places, when his aduerſarie will encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him. A malicious and skilfull aduerſarie deſires but to finde his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnarmed in one part of his bodie, or in one place: ſo is it with vs, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men haue no ſword of the Spirit at home, therefore it comes to paſſe that men that haue good affections in Gods houſe haue baſe and vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4894:231"/> in their owne houſes. Thirdly, it notes that the word muſt be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained and exerciſed in our houſes: for they are not ſaid to dwell with men, that lodge there onely for a night, or a day or two;<note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.112.</note> ſo the ſudden and paſſionate vſe of the word now and then will not ſerue it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plenteouſly]</hi> The originall word notes two things. 1. The meaſure,<note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> and ſo it is well rendred, <hi>plenteouſly.</hi> 2. The worth of the knowledge of the word, and ſo it is by ſome rendred, <hi>richly.</hi> In the firſt ſenſe it teacheth vs that wee ſhould labour by all meanes to abound in the knowledge and vſe of the word. It ſhould be, not in a ſcant and ſparing meaſure, or in ſome parts of it, but we ſhould grow from meaſure to meaſure, and from knowledge to knowledge. In the ſecond ſenſe it teacheth vs, that the knowledge of the word is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians riches, ſo he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>rich in all ſpeech and knowledge.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould account their vtterance in holy and profitable ſpeeches, and conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the inward notions of ſauing knowledge, as their beſt wealth, ſo as they ſhould neuer thinke themſelues poore ſo long as they may haue plenty of knowledge in the vſe of the meanes. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> reckons of his wealth. <hi>Gods ſtatutes more deere to him then thouſands of gold and ſiluer</hi>

                     <hi>In all wiſdome]</hi> Wiſdome is ſometimes taken for vertue, as folly is for ſin; but here I take it for knowledge, and that not as the gaining of heauenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the end of the entertainment of the word, but as it notes the manner how we ſhould entertaine the word.<note place="margin">Of the vviſe vſe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the vvord.</note> This wiſe manner of entertaining the word, I conſider both negatiuely and affirmatiuely: Negatiuely to handle the word wiſely is not to handle or vſe it, Firſt, coldly, fruitleſly, or vnaptly: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, peruerſly, in wreſting the word to ill ends, to nouriſh curioſitie, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſin. Thirdly, carnally as the Capernaites, that know no fleſh of Chriſt, but the fleſh of his body, nor any eating but carnall. Fourthly, not indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we come abroad into company, we ſhould ſo profeſſe and vſe the word, as that we diſhonour it not by indiſcretion, by not heeding places, times, occaſions, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Affirmatiuely to vſe the word wiſely, is in the generall, eſpecially to teach our ſelues. And to this end: Firſt, to vnderſtand it. Secondly, to ſeeke profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things, not curious &amp; pleaſing things only. Thirdly, ſo to try all things, as to keepe that which is good. Good I ſay particularly and for our owne vſe; there be ſome things in hearing, reading, &amp;c. that doe exceedingly, not only affect vs, but are in ſpeciall manner fitting vs: now it is a ſpeciall wiſdome to keepe theſe things whatſoeuer elſe we loſe.

                  <p n="1">1. For reproofe, if it muſt be thus of all entertained, how great a ſinne is it to neglect or contemne the word, and in as much as this is a great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſinne, it is required, and requited by God with foure ſingular curſes. The firſt iudgment vpon the contemners of the word is, that all the comforts

The ſecond iudgement is, that when they doe for faſhion, or for feare, and other ill ends come to heare the preaching of the word, they are many times <hi>ſlaine by the word of Gods mouth,</hi> and the Prophets euen mow downe ſcores, hundreds, and thouſands of them, ſo as they are pierced and galled, ſmitten and buffeted with the terrors of the word, (which is only open to rebuke them) and they ſee that threatning many times comprehends vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it multitudes of men.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This was the obiection in the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> his time, and vttered by ſuch as bare the name of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to whom all the promiſes did belong, and they were anſwered by the Prophet, that for reſoluing of their doubt, they ſhould aske two queſtions of their owne conſciences. The firſt was, whether they thought their workes were like the workes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the reſt of the ancient Saints, to whom ſuch comforts did belong; or whether ſuch vile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe and wickednes were found in <hi>Iacob,</hi> as was apparantly found in them. The ſecond queſtion was, whether they did not ſee that the words of God were alwaies good to ſuch as walke vprightly.

                  <p>The third iudgement is, that all ciuill praiſes in men that contemne the wiſdome of God in the word, are ſingularly vile in Gods ſight, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.8.9. and he inſtructeth in wiſdome.</p>

Yea many of Gods children may be iuſtly rebuked in this, that they are ſo far from ſhewing that the word hath dwelt plenteouſly in them, that whereas for time and the plenty and power of the meanes,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The third generall vſe is for inſtruction.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4894:232"/> as well as a good heart, and no man hath it naturally, wicked men may haue large memories, but not ſanctified to containe holy things: and therefore if men would ſeeke to God in vprightneſſe of deſire: whatſoeuer they loſt, yet the iudgement or anſwer of God in the word preached, or by reading or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, (which reſolueth their doubts, pointeth at the meanes to redreſſe their corruptions, &amp;c.) ſhould not be wholly forgotten. <hi>The iudgements of his righteouſneſſe indure for euer,</hi> that part of knowledge that particularly anſwers their deſires, or the experience of their want in themſelues, this ſhall be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in them by God, ſo as the vertue thereof ſhall neuer be loſt. To conclude ſeeing the holy Ghoſt requires all carefull intertainement of the word, we ſhould do that vnto it that we would do for the entertaining of ſome great man into our houſes. 1. make cleane the roome of our hearts: purge out hypocriſie, malice, &amp;c. 2.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> In admonition wee muſt conſider, firſt, how to performe it: ſecondly, how to receiue it. In performing admonition, wee muſt eſpecially looke to two things: Firſt, that the ground of admonition be out of the word of God, being the <hi>words of Chriſt,</hi> not our owne words. To this end wee ſhould ſtore our ſelues, and hold faſt the faithfull word according to doctrine: Firſt, wee ſhould be conſtantly ſtored with grounds out of the word, both for matters of opinion, and againſt the corruptions of mans life, and for performance of holy duties, that as we haue occaſion wee may rebuke, &amp;c.<note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9.</note> Secondly, wee muſt ſee that the manner of admonition bee right. Admonition is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: Firſt, with <hi>Innocencie;</hi> wee muſt not be faultie our ſelues, or if wee haue beene, we muſt plainly acknowledge it before we admoniſh. Secondly, with <hi>diſcretion,</hi> which muſt be ſhewed in three things: Firſt, that wee be ſure that they haue offended, not led to it by ſuſpicion of our owne hearts, or by heare-ſay, or by outward appearance, not iudge by the <hi>hearing of our eares, and ſight of our eyes</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In receiuing admonition we muſt looke to foure things. We muſt receiue admonition: Firſt, with <hi>loue and holy eſtimation</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7.</note>. Secondly, with <hi>all humilitie,</hi> readily inclined to ſuſpect our ſelues, knowing that we haue cauſe to ſay and thinke of our ſelues as that worthy man did, <hi>I am more fooliſh then any man and haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The vſes are, firſt, to teach vs therefore to ſtirre vp our ſelues to performe this mercy in admoniſhing: for a wiſe man, euen <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſe man, that is, a religious wiſe man may learne wiſdome by it<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 9.9.</note>. Yea it is as a golden earing to the <hi>wiſe and obedient eare</hi>

                        <hi>Iud.</hi> 22.23.</note>. Secondly, we muſt take heed of ſinning againſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. Now men ſinne againſt admonition three wayes. Firſt, in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it: this hath very ill effects, ſuch as theſe; not admoniſhing breedes <hi>dwelling ſuſpitions,</hi> ſuſpitions breed a very habit of <hi>miſinterpretation,</hi> miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation begets a lothneſſe to come vnto the light to ſhew the reaſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, this lothneſſe begets a very ſeparation in heart, ſeparation begets a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of loue</hi> to the meanes, decay of reſpect to the meanes begets a <hi>decay of zeale and gifts,</hi> and from hence there is a high way to internall or externall <hi>apoſtacie,</hi> or ſome great iudgements of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in not performing it aright, as when men make their <hi>wrath to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4894:234"/> fall vpon the fatherleſſe, or digge pits for their friends</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 6.27.</note>, or when men reſpect Gods perſon<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 13.8 9.</note>, and make the pretence of Gods cauſe, glory, name, &amp;c. to be the colour for the venting of their owne particular enuy and diſlike; or when men neuer haue done, but grow impudent, and reproach men <hi>ten times,</hi> and are not aſhamed<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 19.3.</note>. To conclude, when men faile in the manner before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, want innocencie, diſcretion, meekeneſſe, loue, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in not receiuing admonition: and thus men faile diuerſly, when men ſhift, excuſe, denie, extenuate, &amp;c. and yet in heart be conuinced, or when men fall into paſſion, or grudging, or traducing afterwards; or when men would faine make the admoniſher to <hi>ſinne in the word, and lay ſnares for him that rebukes</hi>

                        <hi>Iob</hi> 21.31.32</note>. Many are the ill effects of reſiſting admonition: It is a ſigne of a <hi>ſcorner</hi>

                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.4.5.</note>, men may alſo come to that horrible condition by reſiſting admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that they beeing peruerted ſhall goe about damned of their owne ſoules<note n="r" place="margin">

                  <p>Thus of the generall exhortation.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall exhortation concernes one part of the word, and that is the <hi>Pſalmes.</hi> Which are heere to be conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 In reſpect of matter, <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes, and Spirituall ſongs.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 In reſpect of the manner, <hi>ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The matter is heere three waies to be conſidered: Firſt, in the ground,<note place="margin">What meant by Pſalmes, Hymnes, and ſpirituall Songs.</note> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or authoritie of the Pſalmes we vſe, <hi>viz.</hi> they muſt be the word of Chriſt, that is contained in the Scriptures. Secondly in the kindes of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> there are many ſort of Pſalmes in Scripture. The Pſalmes of <hi>Moſes, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and other Prophets: but all are heere referred to three heads; they are either <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> ſpecially ſo called, or <hi>Hymnes,</hi> or <hi>Songs,</hi> great adoe there is among Interpreters, to find a difference in theſe; ſome would haue Pſalmes to be the ſongs of men, and Hymnes of Angels: ſome thinke they differ e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, in the manner of Muſicke. Some are ſung by voice, ſome plaid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſtruments; but the plauſibleſt opinion is not to diſtinguiſh them, by the perſons that vſe them, or by the kinde of muſicke, but by the matter, and ſo they ſay Pſalmes containe exhortation to maners or holy life. Hymnes containe praiſes to God in the commemoration of his benefits. Songs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doctrine of the cheefe good, or mans eternall felicitie. But I thinke there needs not any curious diſtinction: it may ſuffice vs that there is varietie of Pſalmes in Scripture and God allowes vs the vſe of euery kinde. Thirdly, the propertie of the Pſalmes, they are <hi>Spirituall,</hi> both becauſe they are indited by the ſpirit, and becauſe they make vs more ſpirituall in the due vſe of them.</p>
                  <p>From hence then we may learne theſe things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That ſinging of Pſalmes is Gods ordinance, binding all ſorts of men: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 66.1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 92.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 135.3. a part of our goodneſſe, and a moſt comely thing.</item>
                     <item>2 That a Chriſtian ſhould cheefely recreate himſelfe in ſinging of Pſalmes, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.13. God doth not allow vs other recreations to ſhoulder out this, as the moſt doe.</item>
                     <item>3 That we ſhould ſing Pſalmes in our houſes aſwel as our Churches both for daily exerciſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 101.1.2. and when Chriſtians meet together: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The manner followes;<note place="margin">Rules in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalmes</note> there are foure things required of vs in ſinging of Pſalmes: Firſt, we ſhould <hi>teach and admoniſh</hi> in the vſe of them, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4894:235"/> our ſelues, by conſidering the matter, or others, as the Miniſters in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of Pſalmes for the congregation, or the Maſter of the familie, or when Chriſtians meet, there ſhould be choice of ſuch Pſalmes as may inſtruct or comfort, or rebuke, according to the occaſion: there is edifying euen in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of Pſalmes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. Secondly, we muſt <hi>ſing with grace:</hi> this is diuerſly interpreted; ſome vnderſtand it of the dexteritie that ſhould be vſed in ſinging, to affect our ſelues or others: ſome take it to be that inward come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, right order, reuerence, or delight of the heart in ſinging: ſome would haue it ſignifie thankſgiuing. But I thinke, to ſing with grace, is to exerciſe the graces of the heart in ſinging: we muſt ſing with holy ioy<note n="ſ" place="margin">

                        <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 104.33.34.</note>. Thirdly, wee muſt <hi>ſing with our hearts,</hi> not with our tongues only outwardly for oſtentation: to <hi>ſing with our hearts</hi> is to ſing with vnderſtanding<note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14.</note>, with ſenſe and feeling. Hence wee are ſaid to prepare our hearts before we ſing<note n="y" place="margin">

                  <p>THis verſe containes the ſecond generall rule to be obſerued in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and it is an exhortation to the minding of the right end in all our actions. In the former verſe hee tooke order for the meanes of holy life; here he takes order for the end of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> In generall, vnto the goodneſſe of the action a good end is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally required;<note place="margin">Vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the action, the goodneſſe of the end is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> for though a good intention make not the action good, yet without a good intention the action cannot bee accepted as good in Gods ſight. It is a good thing to heare and follow Chriſt, but not good in the Capernaits, that follow for the loaues; or in the Phariſies, that heare to carpe, or carrie tales, and informe againſt him. It is a good action to vſe our knowledge, but ceaſeth to be good in vs, when it puffeth vp, and is done for vaine oſtentation. It is good to receiue the Sacraments; but yet Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was not good, either as the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> required it, nor as the King and his ſonnes receiued it. Workes of holy and religious ſeruices are good
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4894:235"/> but when men come to Church on the Sabboths, to make amends for their ſinnes on the weeke dayes, it ceaſeth to be good to them. It is good to honour Gods Miniſters; but where men honour them either to keepe their owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the people, as <hi>Saul</hi> honoured <hi>Samuel,</hi> or that they may excuſe them, as in the Parable<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.19.</note>, ſuch honour is not good. Workes of mercy are good; but being done for praiſe of men, or to merit by them, they come vnder a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept, <hi>Giue not your almes.</hi> It is good to forbeare one another, but not good in ſuch men as forbeare onely for want of power or opportunitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: and therefore we ſhould informe our ſelues better,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.</note> and as wee would haue God to accept or bleſſe vs, to get good ends to our actions.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe the end of well-doing is two wayes conſidered: Firſt, as it is the <hi>end of intention,</hi> that is, that wee ſhould propound and aime at, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and marke of our endeuours, and that is ordered and required in theſe words, <hi>Whatſoeuer yee doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> Secondly, as it is the end of conſummation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. that by which wee finiſh our workes, and that is required in theſe words, <hi>giuing thankes to God, euen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him.</hi> In ſhort, the end of intention is the glory of God in Chriſt, the end of conſummation is the giuing of thankes when wee haue done our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt part I conſider:

                  <p>Secondly, that all be done in the name, that is, by the authoritie of Chriſt, and his warrant in his word: not in the name of <hi>Moſes</hi> for ceremonie, or in the name of Angels, or Saints, for interceſſion, nay in all wee doe, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould be tied onely properly by the command of Chriſt, not becauſe ſuch great men would haue it ſo, or I did it to pleaſe my parents or kindred, &amp;c. for then thou doeſt it in the name of men, and not of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that all be done with inuocation or calling vpon God in the name of Chriſt, all ſhould be conſecrate and begun with praier.</p>

Not onely abroad, but at home: making conſcience not onely of filthie deedes, but of filthy ſpeaking, not onely of great and crying ſinnes, but of leſſer ſins: not onely of our open deeds, but of our carriage in ſecret. Vſe is for reproofe, men diſcouer their vnſoundneſſe of heart in this reſpect exceedingly: many will not forſweare that will ſweare at euery word, at leaſt by leſſe oathes, as by the maſſe, faith, troth, truth, &amp;c. many ſhop-keepers will not beare falſe witneſſe in a Court, that will lye daily in ſelling their wares. Many will looke to their carriage abroad, that care not how to order themſelues at home. Many will not doe their owne worke by keeping ſhop, or trauelling on the Sabbath, that neuer ſtick at it to ſpeake their owne words on the Sabbath: but if the caſe of ſuch like men as theſe be to be ſuſpected, how fearefully bad is their caſe that are ſo farre from making conſcience of euery word and deede, as they are to euery good worke reprobate?<note place="margin">Six reaſons vvhy Gods children ſhould bee more carefull of their vvords and deeds then others.</note> that are neither good at home, nor abroad, neither in worſhip nor life, neither to others nor to themſelues. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>vlt.</hi>

Becauſe God hath beſtowed vpon them more bleſſings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he giues more wages, requires more worke. 3. Becauſe they are more obſerued then any other. A looſe word is more noted in them then execrable blaſphemy in others, they are more talked of for ſeeing a vaine ſight then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for haunting of leud playes. 4. Becauſe their hearts are made pure by the bloud of Chriſt: and fine white linnen is ſooner and deeper ſtained then courſe ragges. 5. They are truſted with more glorious riches. A little ſinne in them much grieues Gods ſpirit, whereas a great ſinne troubles not a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that hath no ſpirit of God in him. 6. They are ſure to haue a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward for euery good worde and worke, and therefore to further their owne reckoning and glorie, ſhould bee aboundant in the worke of the Lord.</p>

                  <p>BEfore I come to the particular conſideration of theſe words, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ſomething from the coherence and generall conſideration of all the verſes together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> It is plaine that men are to be taught how to gouerne themſelues in their houſes, as well as in the duties of their generall calling: this is meet to be noted, becauſe ſome mens either ignorance, or wilfulneſſe and prophaneneſſe is ſuch, that they thinke Miniſters ſhould not meddle to tell them how to liue at home, or how to carry themſelues in their ſhops.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. From coherence, that we may liue comfortably, and bleſſedly in our families and particular callings, wee muſt labour in the daily and conſtant vſe of the meanes to be ſincere in the generall. The ſtudie of the word to frame men, to be good men and women in Gods ſight, would make men good husbands, ſeruants, children, wiues, &amp;c. Firſt, get to be a good man, and then thou wilt the eaſier proue a good husband, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt, for reproofe of ſuch as cannot abide to ſee their children, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to heare Sermons, ſtudie the Scriptures, labour for grace, &amp;c. whereas nothing would more fit them to all pleaſing in their carriage at home. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for triall; if religion and the profeſſion of it, make thee not a better wife, husband, or ſeruant, ſuſpect thy ſelfe that all is not right, but that thou art an hypocrite, repent and amend. Thirdly, for inſtruction: if men finde ſuch ſtubbornneſſe in their wiues, or children, or ſeruants, the beſt way is to giue them more libertie to the meanes, and to driue them into Gods houſe to heare the word, to call vpon them to reade the Scriptures, and to vſe ſuch like holy exerciſes; for if this will not mend them, nothing in the world will. 3. Before I conſider of the particular members of a familie,<note place="margin">Of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a familie.</note> I muſt intreat ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of the whole: and concerning the gouernment of a familie by the rules of Gods word, I conſider 4. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The authoritie of it:<note place="margin">1. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of it.</note> there is a way how to walke in vprightneſſe, euen in our houſes, ſo as God will come to vs, if our families be rightly ordered<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2.</note>. There is a wiſdome or ſauing knowledge how to erect and found a holy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and how to order and eſtabliſh it<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 24.3.</note>: there are many adminiſtrations, as the adminiſtration of a Church, of a Citie, or Common-wealth, ſo likewiſe the adminiſtration of a familie, yet but one Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Yea, the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a houſe honeſtly, or in holy comelineſſe, is manifeſtly expreſſed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The antiquitie of it:<note place="margin">2. The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of it.</note> it is the moſt ancienſt of all gouernments, yea out of which all the reſt ſprang: the Church was bred and cheriſhed by this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in families for many hundreds of yeeres in the beginning of the world, euen till the people came out of Aegypt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The vtilitie of it:<note place="margin">3. The vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of it.</note> it is called a <hi>perfect way</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2.</note>, and that in three reſpects: Firſt, as oppoſed to hypocriſie; it ſhewes a mans way is not hypocriticall, when a man will not onely looke to his feet when he goes into Gods houſe, but is carefull how to walke vprightly in his owne houſe. Secondly, as it is the ground and field of practiſe; knowledge is neuer perfect till it bee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the moſt ordinary way of practiſe is at home. Thirdly, as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects vs in bleſſedneſſe, in that it brings Gods promiſe into execution: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the familie is the Seminarie both of Church and Common-wealth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</note> for it brings forth, and brings vp a ſeed, it preſerues the Common-wealth, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4894:238"/> as it frames by education a holy ſeed, it preſerues the charge.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <note place="margin">4. What is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the vvell-being of it.</note>4. What things are neceſſary and requiſite vnto the bleſſed being of a familie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the erecting and eſtabliſhing of a bleſſed familie, three things are principally neceſſary. Firſt, a holy comming together. Secondly, a holy liuing together. Thirdly, a ſpeciall fitneſſe in the head of the familie. For the firſt, it is greatly materiall to the perpetuall well being of a familie, that all heedfulneſſe be obſerued in the firſt erecting of it: for as many order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſo prouoke God by the firſt entring vpon the familie, that the familie trauels euer after vnder the burden of Gods anger, or great inconuenience, and cannot proſper: and thus men fault,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Foule faults in the firſt ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note>Either by ventring without a calling, or meanes to liue, or by ouer-leaping Gods ordinance of contract, or by ventring vpon mariage with perſons that haue foule diſeaſes, as the leproſie, French pox, &amp;c. but eſpecially when</p>
                  <p>Firſt, more wiues then one are brought in. Secondly, there is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtance in bloud, but the mariage is inceſtuous. Thirdly, another mans wife is brought in, either the betrothed wife, or the vniuſtly diuorced wife of another man. Fourthly, there is not conſent of parties, but the mariage is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Fiftly, there is not conſent of parents. Sixtly, an infamous or ſcandalous perſon is choſen to be a yoake-fellow. Seuenthly, there is not equalitie, either for religion (but a beleeuer is matched with an vnbeleeuer) or age, or eſtate, or diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>And a like dangerous diſorder there is in taking into the familie of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſeruants, ſuch as are ſwearers, filthy and ſcandalous perſons, againſt which ſinnes there lie knowne threatnings of God: and ſo with their ſinnes they bring in Gods curſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. Things in a holy liuing together in a familie.</note>The ſecond thing that makes a familie bleſſed, is a holy liuing together, and there are foure things that are requiſite eſpecially to the good eſtate of the houſe. Firſt, the conſtant practiſe of pietie and priuate worſhip. Secondly, the right order of imploiment in the mutuall labours of the familie. Thirdly, houſhold diſcipline or reformation. Fourthly, hoſpitalitie, or a right reſpect of ſtrangers.<note place="margin">6. Things in houſhold pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> For the firſt, the pietie that is to be practiſed ſtands of 6. parts: Firſt, praier and thankſgiuing to God. Men muſt pray euery where<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</note>, our meats and callings muſt be ſanctified by the word, and by praier<note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 4.</note>: thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> praied morning, and euening, and at noone<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.18.</note>, ſo <hi>Daniel:</hi> yea it is a brand of prophane and abhominable perſons, they call not vpon God<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4.</note>. Yea thoſe families are in great danger of his wrath, that call not vpon his name<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20.</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, holy conference betwixt the members of the familie, as betweene huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife<note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</note>, and betweene father and children<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Deu.</hi> 6.21.22</note>. Thirdly, ſinging of Pſalmes<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5 20.</note>. Fourthly, repetition of doctrine publikely taught, examining it by the Scriptures alleadged, as did the <hi>Bereans</hi>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17.</note>. Fiftly, faſting vpon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions, is very plaine, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.16. Laſtly, the parents inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.2.3.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what things may be taught in the familie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What things may be taught in the familie.</note>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, the common grounds of Gods ſeruice and worſhip, this is to teach them to feare God. Secondly, the meaning of the Sacraments<note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.25.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.14.</note>. Thirdly, the Law<note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6.</note>, that is, the common grounds of honeſtie, and vice, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loue ſuch and ſuch vertues, and hate ſuch and ſuch vices. Fourthly, the vſe and conſideration of Gods great iudgements: therefore God will tell <hi>Abraham</hi> of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> becauſe he will make vſe of it in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. Fiftly, the report of Gods great workes of old<note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.2.3.</note>. Sixtly, to hope in God, acquainting them with their naturall miſeries, and training them vp, by warning them to take heed of the common preſumptions of the wicked, and by diſtilling into them the grounds of practiſe and promiſe, concerning Gods
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4894:238"/> mercy to their ſoules and their laſt ſaluation. Seuenthly, we ſhould acquaint our houſholds with the generall courſe of the Scriptures: thus <hi>Timothie</hi> knew the Scriptures of a childe<note n="q" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note>: for an exact knowledge of all Scriptures was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a child to attaine. Laſtly, the things receiued by publike doctrine ſhould be inforced and kept a foot in the familie, if any paſſe theſe bonds they intrude vpon the Miniſters office, and ought to feare <hi>Vzzahs</hi> curſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as men ſhould inſtruct, and ſo auoide the common prophaneneſſe of the world in neglecting Gods ordinance, ſo they ſhould be wiſe to ſobriety, and keepe themſelues in all feare and humilitie within their owne line and meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thus of Piety.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing required is, a holy order of imployment in all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the familie, in their mutuall labours for the good of the outward eſtate of it<note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. Fiue things required in the labours of a familie.</note>: vnto the orderly performance of the labours of a familie, fiue things are required.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, diligence. Secondly, peace, elſe all ſacrifice is in vaine, <hi>Prou.</hi> 17 1. Thirdly, prouidence, it is not the hand of the diligent, but his thoughts that bring abundance: care is required, not the care for ſucceſſe, (for that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) but the care for the dutie, <hi>Prou.</hi> 21.5. Fourthly, retyred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: they muſt keepe at home. Seruants muſt not be ſtealing out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie without leaue: nor Maſters leaue their ſtandings. Keepe thy foot from thy neighbours houſe, <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.17. If a man cannot be found in the place of his labour, he is <hi>like a bird that wandreth from his neſt, Prou.</hi> 27.19. Fifthly, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie, in liuing within their compaſſe, and not ſpending aboue their meanes, they muſt make their <hi>lambes ſerue for cloathing, and the goates for rent or hire of the field, and the milke of the goates muſt be ſufficient for them, and their families, and for the ſuſtenance of the maides, Prou.</hi> 27. <hi>vlt.</hi> It is not a good rule to make reaſon iudge of their needes, or to propound vnto themſelues, I will ſpend no more but what I neede, but they muſt looke to their meanes to ſpend accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that: for ordinarily there is not ſo litle comming in, but God can make it ſuffice, or will himſelfe ſend them ſupply.</p>
                  <p>The third thing required is, domeſticall diſcipline: Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> ſearcheth his houſe, purgeth it of all idols, and ſuperſtitious monuments, admoniſheth his people of the feare of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2, 3. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> ſacrificeth for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.5. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> will ridde his houſe of ſlanderers, lyars, apoſtates, &amp;c. And ſo ſhould we ſee to the reformation of abuſes, by admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, correction, or complaints to the Magiſtrate, or Elders of the Church; the Father in his houſe is the keeper of both Tables.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing is, the right order of hoſpitalitie, and reſpect of ſtrangers, and it ſtands in two things: Firſt, in ſeeking by all meanes to bring Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or ſeruants into our houſe<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</note>, that they might helpe vs, and as it were, bleſſe and perfume our houſes, by their praiers, counſell, comforts, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. Secondly, in prouiding that no ſtrangers be admitted, or permitted that will hinder Gods worſhip, or any way the good of the familie; they muſt not be within our gates, that will not ioyne with vs to ſanctifie the Sabboth in our dwellings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Yea, if they be diſordered perſons, wee ſhould vſe them as the falſe Prophet; that they may ſay, thus was I wounded in the houſe of my friend, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe is: Firſt, againſt the Papiſts, and that principally two waies: Firſt, in that they forbid mariage, and ſo hinder the erecting of families to God. Secondly, in that they forbid knowledge to Lay-people, and ſo hinder the good gouernment of the Familie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, againſt great abuſes euen amongſt vs. There is that open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe in the moſt houſes, that if they ſearched with lights, there would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4894:239"/> no prayer, reading of ſcripture, holy conference, ſinging of Pſalmes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be found there, but without light men may finde their houſes full of ſwearing, deceit, lying, falſe meaſures, and weights, and all kinde of filthines, to the ſingular detriment of the familie: for hence it is that many families, doe in vaine riſe earely, and goe to bed late, and eat the bread of painfulneſſe and ſorrow, for God for theſe ſinnes will not build the houſe. Sometimes this is plagued by open iudgements, ſometimes Gods curſe ſecretly like a moath ears downe the proſperitie of the houſe. But alwaies all ſuch families are very hatefull to God, euen like the dens or cages of wilde beaſts. Secondly, it may humble the beſt of vs, if we ſearch into our neglects, ignorances, and omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the many duties we ſhould performe in our houſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for inſtruction to teach vs by prayer to ſeeke a way of God for vs, and our houſes, and to beſeech God to build vs an houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7.11.25.27.29. and by all meanes to labour to liue godly at home in the practiſe of piety, this is to bring ſaluation to our houſes. Thus our families would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as litle Churches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. Yea; wonderfull hath beene the ſucceſſe of this holy order in ſome families. Thus the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> hath become as the houſe of God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. Yea, if we were thus carefull, God would hedge vs and our families round about, and all that we haue, that Satan could not touch vs, hee cannot breake Gods fence without Gods leaue, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.10. Our tabernacles would then flouriſh and ſtand long, <hi>Prou.</hi> 12.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.11.</p>
                  <q>Thus in generall of houſhold gouernment, or the order generally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the good eſtate of all the members.</q>
                  <p>Now I come to conſider each member in the familie, and the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides them into three couples: The wife and the husband, the childe and parents, the ſeruant and maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctr:</hi> There are two reaſons why the husbands and wiues are charged in the firſt place, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, becauſe that in this order they were thus inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, he firſt made man and wife, and in the order of nature theſe firſt found the familie, and ſo the Apoſtle keeps the order of nature, and the firſt inſtitution. Secondly, becauſe the good behauiour of the inferiours in the families, lieth much in the good example of the husband and wife: if they be filthy, waſtefull, or blaſphemers, vſually their children and ſeruants are ſo; and many times it holds in the contrary, for their good example, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes the familie in imitation grow like them, or at leaſt it reſtraines much euill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> But why is the wife firſt appointed to her dutie, before the husband?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe in the order of the familie ſhe muſt firſt mend before the husband (howſoeuer before Gods iudgement ſeat they ſhall be tried equally) in domeſticall behauiour, if ſhee would haue her husband reformed of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, or ill dealing, ſhe muſt firſt mend her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the generall conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiues be ſubiect to your huſbands as is comely in the Lord.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words, the Wiues dutie is firſt laid downe, <hi>Wiues ſubmit to your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</hi> Secondly, it is inlarged or confirmed: 1. by a reaſon, <hi>it is comely.</hi> 2. by a limitation, <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In laying downe the dutie I conſider: Firſt, who are charged, <hi>Wiues.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with what, <hi>be ſubiect.</hi> Thirdly, to whom, <hi>to your Huſbands.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiues] Doctrine.</hi> All wiues generally and indefinitely are tyed to a holy order of ſubiection to their husbands without diſtinction of yeares, the elder women and the yonger, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.8. and without diſtinction of eſtate, poore mens wiues muſt be ſubiect aſwell as Citizens wiues, or Gentiles, a great fault in the baſer ſort: Their houſes in reſpect of rudeneſſe, are as void of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4894:239"/> as they are of riches. Great mens wiues alſo muſt be ſubiect, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and <hi>Vaſhti</hi> the Empreſſe; yea though there be inequalitie of meanes, as if the wife were a Lady, and the Husband but a meaner man, yet ſhee muſt be ſubiect, and he not waite vpon her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. For comfort of wiues, nothing is required of one, but what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all. 2. Of Husbands, in reſpect no meanes of eſtate, or alteration in their condition can looſe them their honour in the ſubiection of their wiues. And thirdly, euery woman ſhould learne to doe her dutie, ſeeing all are bound to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be ſubiect]</hi> Here I conſider: 1. What is required, <hi>viz: be ſubiect.</hi> 2. In what manner it is required, that is, in the indefinite propounding of it without exception of time or place, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt I conſider: firſt, that it is: ſecondly, I anſwer a queſtion: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what it is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſubiection in women is required without diſpenſation, by God, as as his ordinance is plaine by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Queſtion is why the Apoſtle onely propounds here the wiues ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, without mentioning any other dutie?<note place="margin">Why ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely named in the vviues dutie.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I might ſay it is the wiſdome of God to ſcatter directions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that we may not finde them all in one place, to ſtirre vs vp to the more diligence in ſtudie of the Scriptures, &amp; with great good ſucceſſe many times; for while they are ſeeking to learne to be good wiues, they meete alſo with thoſe directions that make them good women too. God many times when we ſeek one bleſſing cauſeth vs to finde many.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I may ſay that it is the wiſdome of God to epitomize and draw things into a ſhort ſumme, that we may be more familiarly acquainted with his will: Thus when he would propound his eternall rules of all righteouſneſſe in the Law, he chuſeth to giue them in ten words, that men might grow to be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted with them, as with any ordinarie matter, that they might alwaies haue them before their eyes, and binde them to the fringe of their garments: ſo God giues women their duties in one word, that it might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in their hearts, and ſewed downe before their eyes in capitall letters vpon their cuſhions; <hi>be ſubiect</hi> ſhould neuer be out of their mindes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe of the neceſſitie of it, if God may not haue this dutie, he will not accept of the reſt; though they be faire, rich, wiſe, prouident, diligent, &amp;c. yet if they be not ſubiect, they are not regarded of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe women moſt faile in this, the ſpeciall dutie of the husband is loue, and of the wife ſubiection, the man moſt failes in loue, and the woman in ſubiection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I conſider what this ſubiection is: and here, firſt, what it is: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what it is not: thirdly, the meanes that women are to vſe that they may be ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, in the right diſcharge of their ſubiection,<note place="margin">Fiue things in the vviues ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> wiues are tied to fiue things: firſt, honour: ſecondly, faithfulnes: thirdly, feare: fourthly, labour: fifthly, ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>To be ſubiect, is firſt to honour them; to be faithfull, to feare them, to be diligent in labour for them and the familie, and to ſubmit to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They muſt honour their husbands as their ſuperiour, and heads,<note place="margin">Wiues muſt honour their Husbands ſix vvaies.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. and this they muſt doe, firſt, by giuing reuerent titles to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. ſecondly, by ſtriuing to reſemble the very properties &amp; praiſe-worthy qualities of the husband, ſhe ſhould be his image, or his glory. And thus alſo in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhee ſhould reſemble his authoritie ouer the familie: women ſhould chuſe ſuch husbands, as they would not onely liue with and loue, but ſuch as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4894:240"/> they would liue by, euen ſuch as they would ſet before them as patternes of their natures and liues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By liuing without ſuſpition, making the beſt interpretation of their doubtfull actions. <hi>Michol</hi> is made a preſident of contempt and ſuſpition, when ſhee ſo ſinfully taunts and miſinterprets <hi>Dauids</hi> dancing before the Arke, in preſence of the maides of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By leauing to him the ſecrets of his publike imployment, and keeping her to her owne meaſure in caring for domeſticall matters, ſhe may not be of an inquiſitiue humor, to lay a neceſſitie vpon the husband to reueale to her all occurrents, eſpecially when the Husband is either Magiſtrate or Miniſter.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By yeelding him due beneuolence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3. ſhee may not without calling or conſent, refuſe her husbands bed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By ſtriuing to aduance her husbands credit, ſhe muſt not ſhame her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,<note place="margin">Wiues ſhame their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds foure vvaies.</note> 
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.4. Wiues ſhame their husbands, 1. When their feete will not keepe in their owne houſe, <hi>Prou.</hi> 7.11. 2. When they blaze abroad his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. 3. When they neglect the care of his children, either for manners, apparell, or imployment, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 4. By liuing in any ſcandalous ſinne, as when they be falſe accuſers, giuen to much wine, intemperate, &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.3. or buſie-bodies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wiues muſt ſhevv faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in fiue things.</note>The ſecond part of ſubiection is faithfulnes: They muſt ſhew all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 1. In reſpect of the mariage-bed, <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.17. 2. In reſpect of expence, ſhee muſt not be waſtefull, for this is to pull downe the houſe with her owne hands, and euer the more ſecretly, the more ſinfully, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.1. ſhee ſhould ſaue and not ſpend without conſent. 3. In reſpect of the buſineſſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſhee ſhould be ſuch as her husbands heart may truſt in her: it is a great ſinne in wiues when they muſt be told, not onely what to doe, but when they are charged with the care of ſuch and ſuch things, they muſt neede to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually told, and yet be careleſſe ſtill. 4. In the ſecrets of the familie, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing them to ſtrangers, but ſo taking notice of them, as not to diſcouer them without the conſent of the husband, as the faults of <hi>Sion</hi> muſt not bee told at <hi>Gath.</hi> 5. In entertainment, that none be admitted that are ſuſpected or diſliked by the husband.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wiues ſhould ſhevv their feare ſix vvaies.</note>The third thing is feare, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. They ſhould ſhew the feare of their Husbands, 1. By reuerent behauiour to him, not rude audacious bold. 2. By ſtriuing to be inoffenſiue, auoiding or preuenting what might ſtirre him to anger, or diſlike or griefe. 3. By giuing ſoft anſwers when hee is angry, <hi>Prou.</hi> 15. 4. By forbearing paſſion, or frowardneſſe, euen with others in his ſight. 5. Making him her couering when they are abroad, but many women are ſo intemperate and wilfull, that a man might as ſoone hide the winde with his fiſt, or oyle in his hand, as couer the infirmities of his wife, <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.15, 16. 6. By liuing quietly without contention, ſhee muſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, her labour: her labour is of two ſorts. Firſt, to appoint vnto the familie, and ouerſee their waies, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.27. Secondly, ſhee muſt labour with her owne hands, <hi>Prou.</hi> 13.27.19. and this labour of her hands is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with ſix rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Six rules for vviues vvorke.</note>1. She muſt not ſpend moneths or yeares in ſtaying for ſome imployment ſhe could like to make a calling, but ſhee muſt preſently ſeeke by all meanes to finde out labour, <hi>ſhee ſeeketh wooll and flax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Shee muſt not ſtand vpon finer workes, as ſcorning baſer imployment, but be content <hi>to ſet her hands to any labour</hi> that is meete, thus ſhee <hi>ſpinneth and ſeeketh wooll and flax. Pro.</hi> 31.13.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. She muſt not ſpend her time in working of toyes or curious things, good for nothing but to ſhew skill and weare out time, but about profitable things
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4894:240"/> for the familie, as carpets, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. ſheets, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. the clothing of her familie, her husband, and her children, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Shee muſt not lye a bed till nine or ten a clocke, but ſhe <hi>muſt riſe while it is yet night, verſ.</hi> 15. and <hi>her candle is not to be put out by night, verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Shee muſt not be fickle &amp; vnconſtant, to change from worke to worke, to no profit, beginning many things, and finiſhing litle or nothing, but againſt all wearineſſe or other impediments, ſhee muſt girde her loynes with ſtrength, and <hi>ſtrengthen her armes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, all muſt be done cheerefully, not grudgingly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing is, ſubmiſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22. and ſhee muſt ſubmit her ſelfe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To her husbands directions, and liue by the lawes preſcribed her by her husband, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. as the Church doth teach and liue by the word of Chriſt, elſe no true Church. Thus the woman asketh leaue to goe to the Prophet, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.22. And the wife is charged not to faſt without conſent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. And thus alſo ſhee muſt receiue directions for the affaires of the familie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To his reſtraints, ſo as ſhe be contented to be reſtrained of her eaſe, will, deſires, delights, &amp;c. <hi>Thy deſires ſhall be ſubiect to thy huſband, Gen.</hi> 3.19. Thus the Church muſt denie her owne reaſon, profit, pleaſure, &amp;c. and ſubmit her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. Thus muſt the wife caſt about how <hi>to pleaſe her huſband,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.34.</p>
                  <p>Thus of what it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I conſider what it is not, or what the wife is not bound to,<note place="margin">What vviues are not bound to.</note> though ſhee muſt be ſubiect. In generall, their ſubiection doth not lead them into bondage, and make them ſlaues and vaſſals to them, they remaine ſtill their companions and yoke-fellowes.</p>
                  <p>In particular there are ſome things ſpirituall, ſome things domeſticall, ſome things in her ciuill cariage, from which ſhee is not reſtrained by her ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>In matters of religion ſhee cannot be forced to neglect the meanes to ſaue her ſoule, the vnbeleeuing husband cannot compell the wife to forſake her faith and religion, and the meanes thereof, to pleaſe him. Againe, though her ſex barre her from inſtruction in the Church, and her husbands authoritie barre her from ſole inſtruction in the familie, yet notwithſtanding vnder her husband ſhee may inſtruct her children, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.20. and familie, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.26. Beſides, though her husband were neuer ſo great, wiſe, lordly, &amp;c. yet ſhe may admoniſh him, and he ought to be croſſed of his owne courſe and will by her, as <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Sarah,</hi> at Gods appointment, who charged <hi>him to heare her in what ſhee ſaid, to doe it, Gen.</hi> 21.12.</p>
                  <p>In domeſticall matters, ſheels not ſubiected to his tyrannie and blowes, nor is ſhe bound to beare with or conſent to, or conceale his whoredomes, ſhee is not bound to imitate his example, or obey his will, to doe that that is ill. And laſtly her ſubiection doth not binde her to deliuer her body when ſhe is apart for her diſeaſe, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                  <p>In ciuill matters I inſtance in one: She is not vtterly barred out from works of mercy, for though ſhe may not take of his ſubſtance to ſpend it, no not in workes of piety and mercy, yet of her owne labours ſhe may take to giue to the poore, or for pious vſes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.20.</p>
                  <p>Thus of what not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that women may performe this ſubiection; 1. They muſt keepe home. 2. They muſt ſeeke this abilitie of God, for he giues the graces of the wife: Nature makes her a woman, election a wife, but to be prudent &amp; ſubiect is of the Lord, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.14. and there ſhee muſt ſeeke it of God. 3. They muſt preſerue and keepe warme in their hearts the loue of their husbands, for all diſobedience ariſeth of want of loue. Laſtly, they muſt conſider the reaſons
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4894:241"/> and incouragements to ſubiection.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he is thy head and therefore be ſubiect, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11.3. Secondly, if the ſhame of men will not moue thee to be ſubiect, yet haue power on thine head, becauſe of the Angels, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.10. but eſpecially conſider the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould weigh much with them that God hath impoſed ſuch a free and ingenuous ſubiection. It is not boundleſſe, when they may be ſtill compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. That God that requires them to be ſubiect, chargeth husbands to vſe them well, and kindly to accept their obedience. 3. God hath valued the price of a good wife, and ſet the rate to be aboue pearles, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.10. Finally, their labour in the Lord ſhall not be loſt, for they are much <hi>ſet by of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. he will bleſſe them with the fruit of their wombe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 127.3. yea the ſaluation of their ſoules may be furthered by the right performance of familie duties.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the things required, <hi>viz: be ſubiect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner how it is required followes: <hi>Be ſubiect</hi> indefinitely, and ſo ſheweth that they muſt be ſubiect: 1. Not outwardly, but in ſpirit, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. 2. Not abroad onely, but at home. 3. Not ſometimes, but conſtantly alwaies. 4. Not in ſome things, but in euery thing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.24. 5. Not for feare or ſhame, but for conſcience ſake, and voluntarily. Here I may take in the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſubiection is twofold: 1. By Gods inſtitution, and ſo wiues are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, in that they are commanded to be ſo, and God hath taken preheminence from them. 2. By will, or the conſcience cheerefully yeelding obedience to Gods will, and thus onely good wiues are ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the dutie charged vpon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The perſons to whom it is due followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To your huſbands:]</hi> Theſe words may be conſidered excluſiuely and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely, they exclude all others, ſhee is not to be ſubiect to her ſeruants or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the ſtrange woman brought in by the husband; and ſo alſo they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all husbands, they muſt be ſubiect to their husbands, not the wiſe only but the fooliſh, not the courteous onely, but the froward, not the rich onely, but the poore alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the laying downe of the dutie.</p>
                  <p>It is amplified, firſt by a reaſon, <hi>it is comely:</hi> ſecondly, by a limitation, <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As is comely]</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The originall word is rendred three waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As yee ought, vt oportet,</hi> and ſo it is a reaſon from Gods inſtitution, yee muſt doe it, God indiſpenſably requires it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As is meete, vt convenit;</hi> it is meet eſpecially two waies. 1. God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen power ouer all in the family but one, and therefore great reaſon and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ye be appointed ſubiect vnto him, and it is not meet yee ſhould rule ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny if you will not obey one. Againe, yee are profeſſors, and haue giuen your names to Chriſt, and therefore it is meet that you eſpecially ſtriue to be good wiues, and better then any others, leſt the word be euill ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>As is comely, vt decet:</hi> ſo it is here tranſlated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The vviues comelineſſe in three things.</note>The wiues comelineſſe is not in beauty, <hi>Prou.</hi> 11.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31.30. nor in the gorgeouſneſſe of apparell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. but a wiues comelineſſe is eſpecially,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In her wiſdome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.1. and that to be ſhewed in two things: firſt, in her skill to pleaſe her husband, neither offending him with chiding words, nor ſullenneſſe, puling or crying, which is found to vex ſome men more then words. Secondly, in her skill to manage the buſineſſes of the houſe, both ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, diſcreetly, and with prouidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In her meekneſſe it is exceeding comely, where <hi>the hid man of the heart is incorrupt with a meeke and quiet ſpirit,</hi> this is better then all apparell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:4894:241"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, here it is in her ſubiection; for as it is an vncomely thing to ſee the body aboue the head, ſo it is to ſee a wife that will rule and not be ſubiect to her husband.</p>
                  <p>And if the wife labour to adorne her ſelfe thus, ſhee ſhall appeare comely to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. to men in the gate, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.23.31. to her husband and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.28. yea, ſhee is an ornament to ſinceritie and holineſſe it ſelfe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Lord]</hi> 1. Theſe words are expounded diuerſly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the Lord, that is, in the feare of God, as vnto the Lord in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his ordinance, for Gods ſake, becauſe God requires this at your hands.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe it may ſerue for two vſes: Firſt, for terror to wicked wiues, they muſt anſwer it before God, he will auenge their not ſubiecting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, he will certainly account with them, if they be whoriſh, contentious, idle, careleſſe, or waſtefull, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a great comfort vnto a godly woman, her ſubiection is in the Lord, it is in Gods account, euen as a ſacrifice to him, he takes it as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, God honours her obedience in the familie, as if it were piety in the Temple: and this may the more ſupport them, if their husbands be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the Lord, that is, ſo farre as they command in the Lord; they muſt ſo loue their husbands, as they ceaſe not to loue God; and ſo be ſubiect to them, as they leaue not their ſubiection to God. Their couenant with their husband no way inferres the breach of this couenant with God, and thus it is principally here meant.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the Wiues dutie.</p>
                  <p>The Husbands dutie followes in the 19 verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Huſbands loue your Wiues, and be not bitter vnto them.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctr:</hi> In generall; Husbands muſt be told their duties aſwell as Wiues, as they would haue them mend, ſo they muſt mend themſelues; and as they would haue comfort by liuing with them, ſo they muſt make conſcience to practiſe their dutie to them: it is not the hauing of wiues or husbands, that breeds contentment, but the holy performance of duties mutually.</p>
                  <p>The dutie of the Husband is propounded here: Firſt, by exhortation, <hi>Huſbands loue your Wiues.</hi> Secondly, by dehortation, <hi>Be not bitter vnto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the exhortation, there is the perſons exhorted <hi>(Huſbands),</hi> the dutie <hi>(loue),</hi> the perſons to whom they owe it <hi>(your Wiues).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Huſbands]</hi> This indefinite propounding of it ſhewes, that all ſorts of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are bound to ſhew this dutie, poore and rich, learned and vnlearned, yong and old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loue]</hi> Concerning the Husbands dutie as it is here expreſſed, I conſider ſix things. Firſt, that it is indiſpenſably required, Secondly, why this dutie onely is named. Thirdly, how he muſt ſhew his loue. Fourthly, Reaſons why. Fifthly, I anſwer certaine obiections. Sixthly, the lets of performance of loue.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is required, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle names this dutie in this one word, either becauſe the Lord of purpoſe, would haue them ſtudie the whole ſcriptures, that while they ſeeke for directions to make them good Husbands, they may finde alſo counſell to make them good men.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe in this word is comprehended their dutie, that ſo this being their word, they might write it in their hearts, &amp; haue it euer in their eyes to doe it; or elſe it is becauſe this is moſt neceſſarie, and as women faile in ſubiection, ſo doe men in loue.</p>

                  <p>For the third, <hi>viz.</hi> how he muſt ſhew his loue, we muſt vnderſtand, that the husband owes the wife, Firſt, naturall or ciuill loue, as a maried man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſpirituall loue, as a Chriſtian maried man.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: the loue of the husband is to be ſhewed foure waies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. But ſince mariage, ſhee is idle, froward, waſtefull, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a reaſon to moue thee to pray for her, and to watch ouer her waies to admoniſh and inſtruct her, but this is no reaſon to moue thee not to loue her: For the Church ſinneth after calling, and yet Chriſt loues her, and ſhewes it by his interceſſion for her in heauen, and by labouring to clenſe her by his ſpirit and word in earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. But ſhee is a carnall and vnregenerate woman, a meere wicked woman, that neither doth, nor will feare God, and Chriſt doth not loue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes or hypocrites, or prophane perſons, and pagans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though this reaſon from Chriſts example doth not hold, yet the reaſon from Gods inſtitution bindes thee; thou muſt loue her, not becauſe ſhee deſerues it, but becauſe God requires it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is a man bound to eſteeme his wife aboue all women?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In reſpect of the affection and practiſe of the things eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to coniugall duties, he is, but not in opinion of his praiſes, for that is the commendation of the good wife, not of euery wife, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.30.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the Obiections.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the lets follow:<note place="margin">The cauſes vvhy men loue not their vviues.</note> How comes it to paſſe that men do not performe this dutie? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is in ſome by reaſon of their ſinfull comming together, as in ſudden mariages, when they are done before there be a calling or affection in the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rt: So when men haue ill ends, as thoſe men that marry their wiues not for grace or fauour, but for wealth, when they are poſſeſſed of both, they will loue their wealth, and hate their wiues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Corruption of nature is the cauſe of want of loue, they are wicked men, therefore wicked husbands.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It comes to paſſe, becauſe men doe not by praier ſeeke loue of God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of praier and mortification is the cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men loue the ſtrange woman, and therefore loue not their wiues, or they loue other mens wiues.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It comes to paſſe by the vntowardneſſe of the wife, for though that bee no iuſt reaſon to the husband (becauſe he ſhould loue her, becauſe God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him) yet it is a iuſt iudgement of God vpon her.</p>
                  <p>Thus of what is required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loue] viz:</hi> indefinitely: Firſt, in heart as well as in word, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not before others onely, but priuately. Thirdly, not ſometimes, or the firſt weeke, moneth, or yeare, but for euer conſtantly. Fourthly, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, and not for ſhame or reſpect of her friends, or while her meanes doe laſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your Wiues]</hi> This is added; Firſt, to exclude all others, all others I ſay, not from Chriſtian loue in the generall, but from coniugall loue. Secondly, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all wiues, though poore, leſſe wiſe, or frugall, froward, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4894:243"/> Apoſtle doth mollifie the authoritie of the husband, and prouides that it paſſe not into tyrannie. Here I conſider foure things. Firſt, what it hath not in it. Secondly, how men ſhew themſelues bitter to their wiues. Thirdly, the meanes to cure this bitterneſſe. Fourthly, the reaſons to moue thereunto.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, this exhortation to loue, and dehortation from bitternes doth not binde them,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To loue their vices: they may know them to be the weaker veſſell, yea take notice of the weakneſſe of the veſſell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To loſe his owne authoritie by lightneſſe and vaine behauiour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To omit the performance of holy duties to pleaſe her humour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To giue her a licence to doe what ſhee liſt, and liue how ſhee will.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From finding fault and reprouing, ſo as they vſe not their owne words, but Gods.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, diſtinguiſh their natures, wiues of ſoft and gentle natures muſt be vſed with all gentleneſſe, but that lets not but that wilfull and ſtubborne wiues may be held downe to a meet ſubiection.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Men ſhew their bitterneſſe: Firſt, by words, and that diuerſly, when they reproch them for their infirmites,<note place="margin">Of bitter huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> or deformities; or when they grow quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellous, finding fault with euery thing, or grow into paſſion vpon euery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Secondly, in deeds, by vſing them diſcourteouſly, or by vniuſt reſtraint. Or laſtly, by blowes. Many men haue litle growing in their furrowes but wormwood, they haue a true gall of bitternes in them, they may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſtarre in the Reuelations, 8.11. for as that made the third part of the waters bitter, ſo are more then three parts of the words of many husbands bitter words; yea as if their naturall frowardnes were not enough, ſome men will ſharpen and whet their tongues to ſound out curſed words like ſwords or arrowes; yea ſome are ſo vnappeaſable, their anger is like the fooles wrath, <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.3. theſe are a brood of Caldeans, a bitter, a furious nation.</p>
                  <p>For the cure of this bitterneſſe, foure rules are to be obſerued:</p>
                  <p n="1"> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 1. Men muſt pray God to caſt ſomething into their fountaine to ſweeten it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Foure rules for curing of this bitternes in men.</note>2. They muſt turne the courſe of this humor, and ſpend it vpon their ſins, in the practiſe of the duties of mortification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eat Gods booke, for that will inable men to godly ſorrow, (by being bitter in their bellies) and will ſweeten their mouthes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Looke to the rootes of bitternes, ſtay the ſpring of it in the beginning, take heede of a cuſtome in frowardneſſe, for then onely cuſtome in the vſe of the meanes will cure thee; againe it will coſt them daily ſorrowes, before they can get their natures throughly healed.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, the reaſons follow why they muſt mortifie bitterneſſe.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle requires that all bitterneſſe be put away, all for degrees, (it is not inough we are not ſo bad as ſome be) and in all perſons.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, it is a part of our good workes, and holy conuerſation to mortifie bitterneſſe, and enuie, and ſtrife, hereby we muſt ſhew that we haue the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is from aboue: for if our knowledge be right, it will make vs peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated.

                  <p>Vſe is for inſtruction to all husbands that feare God, to approue themſelues vnto God, in their ſincere and louing behauiour towards their wiues, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they ſhould take notice of this vice of bitterneſſe, or if they haue failed this way, they ſhould recouer themſelues, repent and amend, and not be like thoſe wretched perſons that draw iniquitie with cords of vanitie, and call bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweet; it is ill to fault this way, but worſe to excuſe, defend, or denie it.</p>

                  <p>Thus of the duty, the reaſon followes.</p>
                  <p>There are many reaſons why they ſhould obey:<note place="margin">Reaſons vvhy children ſhould obey their parents.</note>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Children haue their ſubſtance from them, euen their life and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, their Parents then tooke care of them when they had no ragge to couer their nakedneſſe, nor morſell to put into their mouthes, and what can children render equiualent hereunto?</item>
                        <item>2. Chriſt himſelfe was obedient to his Parents, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.51.</item>
                        <item>3. This is the puritie and vprightneſſe of children, and hereby they muſt be tried, and tried whether their worke be pure, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.11.</item>

                        <item>5. If thou obey not thy Parents, thou maiſt liue to bee required by thy children.</item>
                        <item>6. In the ſixth of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.2.3.4. There are many reaſons why children ſhould obey.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is the Lord, that is, their obedience is both commanded by God, and it is for God, and beſides it is no further vrged then as may ſtand with faith and piety to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is right, it is childrens iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this commandement that requires this, is the firſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with promiſe, for this had a promiſe in the very firſt promulgation of it in the Tables, written by the finger of God, whereas all the reſt had their promiſes annexed afterwards by the miniſtrie of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the ſecond Commandement had promiſe in the firſt promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some anſwer the words of the ſecond Commandement are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, not a promiſe, but this anſwer ſatisfieth not. Some ſay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes mentioned in that commandement, belong to the whole Law, and not to that Commandement alone; but I thinke the plaineſt anſwere is: the fift Commandement is the firſt Commandement with promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table. A fourth reaſon is, children muſt obey, for ſo it ſhall go well with them; they ſhall get good and contentment, and Gods grace and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by ſo doing. Fifthly, they ſhall liue long on earth to enioy the bleſſing of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> Wicked children liue long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their life is a death, and it is not well with them. <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> Gods children doe not liue long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the moſt part they doe. 2. I ſay, if God performe not this promiſe abſolutely in the letter, yet he performes this bleſſing by commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a better, as when he giues them eternall life for long life.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſon why children ſhould obey is here mentioned in the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is well pleaſing to the Lord:]</hi> Some leaue out <hi>(to the Lord)</hi> and ſo the argument is more generall, for obedience is exceeding pleaſing to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.1. and 15.20. and 19.13. and 13.16. and beſides it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, but I ſee no reaſon to leaue out the words.</p>
                  <p>Some render (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and ſo here is; Firſt, a limitation, they muſt obey, but in the Lord. Secondly, they muſt obey, not becauſe nature
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4894:245"/> and ciuilitie requires it, but for conſcience ſake, as Gods inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But I take it as it is here rendred, <hi>to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Well-pleaſing to the Lord]</hi> From the conſideration of theſe words, I obſerue foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is not enough to ſerue God, but wee muſt ſo ſerue as we pleaſe him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that there is a way how to pleaſe God euen in Family duties, and theſe externall and ordinarie things at home, and this ſerues; Firſt, to ſhew Gods great loue to man, in that he frames himſelfe to mens condition, and likes what may like them, will be pleaſed himſelfe with what pleaſeth them: obedience and ſeruice to men he accounts a ſeruice to himſelfe. Secondly, it is a great incouragement to diligence, and conſcience in theſe Family duties, in as much as they will not only pleaſe man, but God. Thirdly, it reproues hypocrites, that care to be good no where but in Gods houſe, but God will haue obedience and not ſacrifice, yea, here he will be ſerued with obedience to men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that euen children are bound to make conſcience of their waies, and to learne to pleaſe God in their youth. Firſt, God requires it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, there are worthy examples to excite them recorded in Scripture, as the examples of <hi>Ioſeph, Samuel, Dauid, Ioſiah, Ieremie, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> yea, this was a great praiſe in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> young and dying ſonne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.3. Thirdly, a conſcionable care in children to pleaſe God is much prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture, they are bleſſed that beare the yoke in their youth, and the workemanſhip of grace and obedience in the hearts and liues of children, is like the grauing of a Kings Pallace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.12.

                  <p n="2">2. Parents ſhould learne alſo to be content that their children ſerue and pleaſe God as well as them; ſome Parents are ſo bad that they neither will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their children themſelues, nor abide it, that they ſhould heare ſermons, read the Scriptures, ſeeke the companie of ſuch as feare God, or ſanctifie Gods Sabbaoths.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This ſhould teach all to repent euen for the ſinnes of their youth, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. For they were then tied to pleaſe God aſwell as afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That God will be pleaſed and will accept the indeauours and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cares and obedience, euen of children, this is a comfort to children that though they cannot pleaſe wayward parents, yet they ſhall pleaſe God; and againe, it reproues froward parents; Is God pleaſed and art thou diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Doth God loue and like the deſires and endeauours of his childe and doſt thou diſlike?</p>
                  <p>Thus of childrens duty, the Parents duty followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fathers prouoke not your children to anger, leaſt they be diſcouraged.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> From the coherence; Parents muſt performe their duty to their children, it is not an eaſie thing to be a Father and mother in performance of fatherly and motherly duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prouoke not] D.</hi> Men are in general here to learne, that it is not enough to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſin, but they muſt abſtaine from all prouocations to ſin; It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to abſtaine from whoredome, but men muſt abſtaine from wanton at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, from ſuſpected places, from filthy ſpeeches, from cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bering &amp; wantones, not enough to abſtaine from murther, but men muſt abſtaine from bitter and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4894:245"/> prouoking words. It is not enough to abſteine from Idolatry, but men muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from all the monuments and occaſions of Idolatry and therefore men muſt abſtaine from all marriage with Papiſts, and from making of images of the trinity, &amp;c. If men would auoide periury, they muſt take heed of common ſwearing. So Miniſters muſt not only call for peace and vnitie, but they muſt take heed of prouocations to diſcords, when all is at peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                  <p>The words of this verſe are a dehortation, and therein is: Firſt, the duty of parents: Secondly, the reaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parents]</hi> All Parents are tied to performe their duties to their children,<note place="margin">By Fathers he meanes both Parents.</note> none are too good to doe it. Vſe for reproofe of ſuch women as thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too good to nurſe their owne children, and of ſuch Fathers as turne the Care of their children wholly to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prouoke to wrath]</hi> Here I note the manner of ſetting downe their duty and the matter.</p>
                  <p>The dutie of parents is negatiuely ſet downe, to teach that parents muſt not thinke onely of their ſinnes againſt God and abroad to others; but they may be guiltie of much ſinne in treſpaſſing againſt their owne children, if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were otherwiſe neuer ſo honeſt or religious, yet the careleſſe diſcharge of their duty to their children may much prouoke God, and will certainely be found on their ſcore if they repent not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why is the dutie of parents in this place ſo ſparingly ſet downe but in one branch of it and that negatiuely?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not to allow Parents to be leſſe carefull, but it may be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpares them heere, becauſe in reſpect of other relations they are charged before and after as husbands and maſters. Againe, it may bee the Apoſtle would haue children to know they haue not that liberty to inquire into their parents faults, or to reckon it as a part of their skill to finde them out: parents ſhall account to God but not to their children. Thus of the manner of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their duty downe, the matter followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prouoke not]</hi> Parents fault two waies, either by too much ſeuerity, or by too much indulgence, the former is here reſtrained. Againe, the prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is two-fold, either to ſinne or to paſſion, it is a moſt curſed thing for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to prouoke their children to ſinne by counſelling them to euill waies, or incouraging them to lewd courſes. This the Apoſtle holds too horrible vile, for any profeſſing religion, or the feare of God, and therefore mentions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation to anger.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this prouocation to anger I conſider three things. Firſt, how parents prouoke their children. Secondly, what they muſt doe that they bee not prouoked. Thirdly, what is not forbidden in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Parents prouoke their children; firſt, by word; ſecondly, by deed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By word three waies. Firſt,<note place="margin">How parents prouoke their children both by vvords and deeds.</note> by burthening them with vniuſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet precepts. Secondly, by purſuing them with contumelious words, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they be alwaies chiding and rating of them. Thirdly, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing of them to others before their face, or behinde their backes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By deedes fiue waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by careleſſe education, for though children find not fault with this at firſt, yet when they come to be of yeeres, and finde their owne vnfitneſſe for calling or ſociety, &amp;c. then they fret againſt their parents neglect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by diſcourteſies and vnkind vſage of them when they be grown to be of yeeres.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by vniuſt dealing about their marriages, when either they reſtraine them of marriage, when they haue a calling to it, and a liking of meete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thus they prouoke them to incontinency, or when they compell
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4894:246"/> them to marry when they haue no calling nor liking, and thus they prouoke them to diſcontent.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by indiſcreet and immoderate paſſion and ſeuerity in correcting them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, by vniuſt reſtraints either of preſent neceſſaries of food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.9.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Prou.</hi> 13.22. or in not ſaying vp for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that parents may not prouoke their children. 1. They muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin betimes to teach them their duties, for ignorance is waiward. 2. they muſt ſow the ſeedes of piety and godlineſſe in their hearts, as they draw out reaſon by degrees, ſo there is a conſcience euen in children as well as reaſon if it were informed, and conſcience would make them not onely religious to God, but dutifull to parents. 3. They muſt not giue their children too much libertie at the firſt, for if they doe, then will iuſt reſtraint afterwards be prouocation. 4. They muſt pray for them to God, many pray for children, and ſo for their being, that afterwards neuer pray to God to guide their hearts, and ſo for their well being. 5. They muſt in generall ſtriue to teach or guide them by incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and allurements, correction is not as diet, but as Phiſicke, and thus recreation is not to be denied them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.5.6. If nothing elſe will reſtraine paſſion in children, they muſt impoſe ſilence vpon them, he that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſilence on a foole mittigateth anger, <hi>Prou. v.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This dehortation hindreth not but that parents may:

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of the dutie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Children]</hi> viz. All children, ſonnes and daughters in law as well as naturall children; and theſe are prouoked.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By groundleſſe iealouſies and ſuſpitions teſtified by ſecret liſtning, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning and enquiring enuiouſly after euery thing they do or ſay.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By ſuffering ſeruants to vexe or moleſt them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By euill reports of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By giuing euill counſell, or reporting of faults to the Sonne againſt his wife, or to the daughter againſt her husband to make debate is ill in any but much worſe in parents.</p>
                  <p>This of the parties to whom they owe this dutie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leſt they be diſcouraged]</hi> the reaſon followes.</p>
                  <p>There are many reaſons why parents ſhould be carefull by all meanes to keepe anger out of their Children.<note place="margin">7. Reaſons to preuent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>But to omit the reaſons, here parents muſt not prouoke their children leſt they be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Concerning diſcouragement in generall, we muſt know that it is a great ſin to diſcourage others, and a great hurt to be diſcouraged, the people muſt not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4894:246"/> diſcourage their Teachers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. thoſe that are in authoritie muſt not diſcourage ſuch as are faithfull and deſirous to approue their feare of God, and to diſcharge their duties. Gouernours in the familie muſt not diſcourage ſeruants or children in their good beginnings and deſires after good things.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14.</note> Againe this is a Chriſtian mercy &amp; compaſſion, to comfort and incourage the feeble, and laſtly Gods fainting children ſhould be admoniſhed to be of good comfort, and to ſtrengthen their weary knees, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Eſay</hi> 36.3.4.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the diſcouragement of children, Chriſtian parents ſhould be carefull: for they may be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the ſeruice of God when they ſhall ſee carnall men vſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren better then they that make ſuch a profeſſion of piety.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the capacitie and deſire after the vndertaking of the knowledge or exerciſe of great things, diſcouragement breakes their ſpirits, and makes them puſillanimous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the hope to pleaſe and ſo from the confidence of the parents loue, and then at length from the very meanes of pleaſing either by honour or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. This of the duty of parents and children.</p>

                  <p>IN all the words that concerne the dutie of Seruants I obſerue:

                        <item>1. An exhortation, verſ. 22.23.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The exhortation is two waies to be conſidered: firſt as it is breifly ſet down, here is firſt the parties exhorted <hi>(Seruants):</hi> Secondly, the duty wherewith they are charged <hi>(be obedient):</hi> thirdly, the perſons to whom, to your maſters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, as it is explicated in the explication, I conſider,
<list>
                        <item>1. The prouiſoes about their obedience.</item>
                        <item>2. The forme or manner how they muſt obey.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The prouiſoes are either for limitation to curbe Maſters, they are to obey according to the fleſh, the ſoules and conſciences are not in bondage to men, or for extent to ſeruants, they muſt obey in all things.</p>
                  <p>The manner how they muſt obey is ſet downe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Negatiuely, not with eye ſeruice: 2. Not as men pleaſers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Affirmatiuely, with ſingleneſſe of hart: 2. with feare of God: 3. heartily as to the Lord. The reaſons are, 1. from hope of reward &amp; wages from God, v. 24. 2. From the certain vengeance of God vpon them that do wrong, v. 25.</p>
                  <p>This is the order of the words.</p>
                  <p>From the generall conſideration of all the words I obſerue 5. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſeruants are to be inſtructed out of the word;<note place="margin">5. Things ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</note> which reprooues Maſters that reſtraine ſeruants from hearing the word in Gods houſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not the booke of God to them in their owne houſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A queſtion may here be mooued, why ſhould the duety of ſeruants be thus largely in ſo many words ſet downe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe vſually men ſhew leſſe compaſſion to ſeruants: therfore God takes the more care of them, many men will haue ſome care of their children, to ſee them taught in ſome manner, but their ſeruants they wholly neglect. Therefore God who is a Father to ſeruants as well as children, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides large inſtruction and comforts for ſeruants, if they will come to his booke to be taught.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The carefull Apoſtle ſaw that in the firſt conuerſion of men from Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme to Chriſtianitie, there was greateſt danger of diſorder &amp; ſcandall in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4894:247"/> partly out of wearineſſe of their bondage and ſeruile condition, partly becauſe men would leſſe ſpare to tell of their faults, therefore the Apoſtle as moſt fearefull of them ſpends many words in the teaching and incouraging of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may note here the candor of the Apoſtle, he doth freely deliuer his mind in the behalfe of ſeruants with a full vent of words, with great care with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding backe any thing that belongs vnto them. He was not of the mind of moſt Preachers now adaies, that hold the diſcourſe of family duties, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſeruants, too baſe a ſubiect for their wits and learning to be imploied in, neither was the Apoſtle of the humour of Lawyers, that ſeldome ſpeake much but for great men, or when they may haue great gifts, the Apoſtle ſpeaks as much for a ſeruant that could do nothing for him as for the Maſters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In laying downe his ſpeech to ſeruants, he both teacheth and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, but for order he firſt teacheth them, and as any is more ignorant, this courſe is more needfull to be held, the common people ſhould be in this manner dealt withall, they muſt firſt be rebuked, conuinced, exhorted, taught and then meet comforts to be applied; and not before.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle in all theſe words is to keepe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in order, and that firſt to hold ſeruants in obedience, that none vnder colour of liberty in Chriſt ſhould breake vp their ſubiection to their Maſters. He was no Anabaptiſt. Secondly, to meet with the faultie obedience of ſuch ſeruants as were reſolued to ſtay in ſeruice. Hee meeteth here with fiue faults in ſeruants.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <note place="margin">Fiue faults in Seruants.</note>1. The firſt fault in Seruants is halfe ſeruice, or to obey in what they liſt, this he correcteth, when he ſaith <hi>(in all things)</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond fault is eye-ſeruice.</item>
                     <item>3. The third fault is prophaneſſe, moſt ſeruants neuer reſpect piety and Gods feare, but onely to pleaſe their Maſters, this hee mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with when he ſaith, not as men pleaſers, but fearing God.</item>
                     <item>4. The fourth fault is hypocriticall ſeruice, this he meeteth when he addeth in ſingleneſſe of heart.</item>
                     <item>5. The fifth fault is baſeneſſe of minde and diſcouragement, this he would preuent in the two laſt verſes.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seruants]</hi> The Seruants in the Apoſtles time were for the moſt part bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues, bought and ſold as beaſts, and their Maſters were Infidels and cruell to them; and yet many of theſe Seruants were conuerted to the faith of Chriſt. Where we may learne, that mens ſlaues may be Gods ſeruants, hee hath his elect among theſe; the deare children of God in this world may bee abaſed to moſt vile miſery, and a moſt ſeruile condition.</p>
                  <p>The Vſes are: Firſt, to ſhew that felicitie is not in outward things, for Gods ſeruants that had attained the chiefe good, yet were in moſt baſe condition, in reſpect of the things of this life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to teach vs patience in leſſer croſſes, whatſoeuer thou art, yet thou art not a bondſlaue, therefore bee patient; ſuch as haue beene deare in Gods ſight haue beene worſe vſed then thou art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to teach vs compaſſion to the baſer ſort of men, for Gods elect may be among theſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this is a great comfort to the abiect.</p>
                  <p>But howſoeuer bought ſeruants were moſt vſuall in the Apoſtles time, yet hired ſeruants were vſed then too, and are here meant, aſwell as the other, yea, all ſeruants though they were nobles ſeruing in Princes Courts, are tied to the duties generally here required.</p>
                  <p>And as any ſeruants haue more knowledge and doe profeſſe ſinceritie in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4894:247"/> religion, they are the more tied to bee carefull ſeruants to men, they ſhould not onely be better men and women, but better ſeruants alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the parties exhorted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be obedient]</hi> Here I conſider 2. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they muſt obey, they muſt approue themſelues to their Maſters not by wearing their cloth, or cogniſance, or by words and complements, but by painefull and carefull obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How they muſt obey, and that may be opened thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, with reuerence, with all honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. both internall,<note place="margin">4. Things in the manner of ſeruants obedience.</note> with high account and eſtimation of their Maſters, and externall, with reuerent words and behauiour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, with all feare, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5. and this they ſhould ſhew, firſt, by auoiding what might offend. Secondly, by not anſwering againe. Thirdly, by a holy endeauour to pleaſe them. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, with ſubiection, to rebukes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. 2. to correction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 19.20. 3. to their reſtraints: firſt, in reſpect of diet, they muſt not be their owne caruers. Secondly, in reſpect of place, they muſt keepe the bounds of the Familie, and not at their pleaſure be gadding out either by night or day vpon any pretence without leaue. Thirdly, in reſpect of companie, they muſt bring none into the Family, that are lewd perſons, or of what ſort ſoeuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the liking of the Maſter, nor may they keepe company abroad to the iuſt offence of their Maſters. Fourthly, in reſpect of apparell, though they haue neuer ſo good meanes, yet they muſt bee attired as becommeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
                  <p>And this ſubiection alſo they ſhould ſhew in a ready acknowledgement of their fault when they vnderſtand it. It is a great fault in Seruants that though they vnderſtand, yet they will not anſwere. Firſt acknowledge and giue glory to God, and ſubmit themſelues to their maſters, <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.19.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Withall good faithfulneſſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. this faithfulneſſe is required:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the goods of the family, and thus they muſt ſhew their faithfulneſſe in not daring to purloyne the leaſt penny from their Maſters: no pickers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. 2. It is not enough that they are true, but they muſt bee thriftily carefull to ſee that nothing be ſpoiled or loſt, or miſcarry any way by their default and negligence, this was the great teſtimonie of <hi>Iacobs</hi> faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.36.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of ſecrets, they muſt keepe the ſecrets of the Maſter, and of the family, yea and of the trade and calling to.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the buſineſſe of the family, and here their faithfulneſſe ſtandeth in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In diligence of labour, hee is not a faithfull ſeruant that eats the bread of Idleneſſe, as many ſeruing-men do, that can tell of no calling but attendance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In truſtineſſe, and in this ſeruants muſt be faithfull two waies: firſt in their care to ſee their Maſters directions executed in the familie, as if they had beene preſent: ſecondly, in their ſpeedy diſpatch of buſines abroad, a ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meſſenger is an exceeding prouocation to them that ſend him, and it is a wretched fault in ſeruants, when they are ſent forth of the familie about buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they cannot find the way in againe in any due time.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the dutie to which they are exhorted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To them that are your Maſters]</hi> They muſt be ſubiect and obedient to all Maſters, indefinitely without difference of <hi>Sexe</hi> (and ſo to the wife or wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.) or of <hi>condition</hi> they muſt bee obedient to the pooreſt as well as the rich.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the laying downe of the exhortation. The explication followes, and firſt of the prouiſoes. <hi>According to the fleſh.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:4894:248"/>
                  <p>Theſe words may be referred to Maſters, and then the ſenſe is this, that ſeruants muſt be obedient euen to ſuch Maſters as are fleſhly, and carnall men, they muſt obey though their Maſters be Ethnikes or prophane perſons; it is a great praiſe for a ſeruant to men, to bee Gods ſeruant alſo, but it is a greater praiſe to be a religious ſeruant of an irreligious Maſter, to feare God in a prophane houſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſeruants, and ſo they are a limitation, they are ſubiect onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their fleſh and bodies, and ſo here is two things to be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>The one expreſt: the bodies of ſeruants are in the power, and at the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Maſters, and therefore ſeruants muſt learne to ſubiect their fleſh to their Maſters, both commands, reſtraints, and corrections.</p>
                  <p>The other implied: the ſoules of ſeruants are not in the power and at the diſpoſing of Maſters, their ſpirits are free, nor Maſter nor King can command the conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is, firſt, for reproofe of ſuch ſeruants as giue more to their Maſters then is due, thou oughteſt to be of the ſame calling, trade, labour, &amp;c. that thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is of, but thou art not bound to be of the ſame religion, or humour with thy Maſter. It is a great fault not to giue the body to thy Maſter, but a great fault alſo, to giue both body and ſoule to bee at his diſpoſing, both are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſhould ſeruants feare their Maſters becauſe they haue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the fleſh? how much more ſhould we feare God, that hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoule and fleſh in hell, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this may be a great comfort to a ſeruant, thy ſoule is as free as the ſoule of him that ſits on a throne, thy ſeruice in the fleſh derogates nothing from the libertie of Chriſt in thy heart. Thy beſt part is free.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In all things]</hi> Seruants muſt obey in all things, euen in things that bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their credit, profit, liking, eaſe, &amp;c. There is a great ſturdineſſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeruants, either they will not doe ſomethings required, or not at the time when they are bidden, or not in the manner, but as they liſt, theſe courſes are vile, and here condemned.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, If the matter required be only inexpedient, and vnmeet, thou muſt obey: neither doth this rule let, but that ſeruants or inferiours may vſe all humble and lawfull meanes to preuent vnmeet things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou muſt be ſure it be ſinne that thou refuſeſt, thou muſt not diſobey vpon conceit, or coniecture, nor vpon thine owne humour and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but it muſt appeare by the word of God to bee a ſinne, or elſe thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures are no ground of diſobedience, if thou muſt needs doubt on both ſides it is better doubt and obey, then doubt and diſobey.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when it is apparant to be impious and ſinnefull that is required, yet thou muſt looke to the manner of diſobedience, thou muſt yeelde thy ſelfe to obey by ſuffering; yea, it is a wretched fault in ſeruants or inferiours, that are vrged to vnlawfull things, to refuſe with ſturdie, and inſolent, and prouoking words, or behauiour, God frees thee from diſobedience in act, but he frees thee not from reuerence, and from an holy eſtimation and humble demeanour.</p>
                  <p>The vſe is for great reproofe of ſeruants, both indiſcretion and ſtubbernes, and withall it chargeth maſters; they muſt not require their ſeruants to lie and ſweare in their ſhops onely to pleaſe and profit them, nor may they make their ſeruants breake Gods Sabbaths to ſatisfie their wils.</p>

Firſt, ſo to pleaſe men, as neuer to care for pleaſing God; ſo to attend a corporall ſeruice as not to care for the ſauing health of their ſoules, this is prophanneſſe. Secondly, ſuch ſeruants are here taxed, as ſeeke by all meanes to pleaſe their maſters, but not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, ſuch are they that are flattering ſoothing perſons, that ſerue their Maſters onely with faire words, but elſe are emptie perſons; ſuch (or rather worſe) are they that apply themſelues to their Maſters humors, to feed them with tales, or praiſing their ill courſes and counſels, or executing their ſinfull mindes: theſe ſeruants are many times the firebrands of contention, alienate parents from their children, friend from friend, and keepe malice on perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall foote: theſe are here rebuked. But let vs conſider further, is this ſuch a fault in poore ſeruants (that can pretend many things) to be men-pleaſers, how foule a vice is it in freemen that are in no wants or reſtraint, how hurtfull is it to be a man-pleaſer in the Courts of Princes, and in the houſes of Nobles? how deteſted a vice is it in ſuch as are Magiſtrates and publike ſtates? And is it nought in the Court and Countrey, certainely it is much more vile in the Pulpit, and in Churchmen, and euen the greater they are, the worſe and more abominable is their ſoothing and daubing.</p>

                  <p>Singleneſſe of heart may be diſcerned by the contrarie to which it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it is oppoſed to hypocriſie, a ſincere hearted man is no hypocrite, and ſhewes it three waies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hovv to knovv ſingleneſſe of heart by 6. things to vvhich it is oppoſed.</note>Firſt, hee had rather be good then ſeeme ſo, as in caſe of almes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. compared with <hi>Math.</hi> 6.2. ſo in the practiſe of piety, he had rather haue grace and ſound knowledge then an emptie ſhew of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he will ſerue God at all times as well as at one time: it is a note of an hypocrite that he will not pray at all times, hee will ſerue God when he is ſicke, but not when he is well, <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.7.8.9. So it is vile hypocriſie to come to Church in Lent to heare Sermons, but neuer come there, or but ſeldome all the yeere after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he minds inward ſecret domeſticall holineſſe and piety, as well as outward open and Church holineſſe, hee is an hypocrite that kneeles downe when he comes into the Church and neuer praieth in his family at home. It is vile hypocriſie and palpable, in ſuch men as haue knees of praier when they firſt come vp into the pulpit, and no words of praier when they are riſen vp to ſpeake for or to Gods people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is oppoſed to fleſhly wiſedome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. There is a threefold wiſedome of the fleſh that batters and keepes out ſingleneſſe and ſinceritie of heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is a reaching after priuate ends in publike imployments, as preaching for gaine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is a cunningneſſe in committing or hiding ſinne. It is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to be wiſe to doe good, and ſimple concerning euill to be a bungler in acting it, and to haue nothing to ſay in defence of it when it is done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is fraud, ſhifting, ſubtiltie, and guilefull and deceitfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in mens courſe for the things of this life. Thus <hi>Eſau</hi> is a wild and cunning man, able by reaſon of his craft and ſubtiltie to liue in a wildernes, but <hi>Iaakob</hi> is a plaine man, a ſingle hearted man, he can make no ſhift to helpe himſelfe in earthly things by fraud or craft, but is open and plaine in all his dealings for the world; but a man of great reach for matters of his ſoule. This is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of true ſinglenes, ſimplicitie, and ſinceritie. 3. As it is oppoſed to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, oppoſed I ſay to a heart and a heart, and a double hart is either a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering heart, or a diuided heart: men haue a double heart that wauer and are toſſed with vncertainties, ſuch as are now for God and godlineſſe, and ſhortly after for ſinne and the fleſh; now are reſolued to leaue ſuch a fault, as perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is a fault, and by and by they will to it againe, as perſwaded it is not a fault: here is no ſingleneſſe of heart. And thus the heart is double in reſpect of times, it is double alſo, as diuided in reſpect of obiects, I inſtance in two things: firſt in matter of worſhip, the people that came to inhabite Samaria had a diuided heart, for they feared the God of the Countrey, becauſe of the Lions and they feared the gods of the nations alſo, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.33. Such are they that feare Gods threatnings in his word, and feare the ſignes of heauen too. Secondly, our Sauiour inſtances in matters of the world. The minde which is the eie of the ſoule cannot be ſaid to be ſingle, when it is diſtracted, men cannot ſerue God and Mammon, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.21.22.23.24.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As it is oppoſed to ſpirituall pride, a ſingle heart is an humble heart as <hi>Iob</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.15.16. and ſheweth it ſelfe in two things: Firſt, that if God ſend croſſes, it will not anſwer or iuſtifie it ſelfe, but make ſupplication, and ſo acknowledge Gods loue, as withall it will confeſſe that God doth iudge them for their corruptions. Secondly, if the ſincere hearted man pray to God and the Lord be pleaſed to anſwer him by vnutterable feelings, euen by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſpirit of adoption, yet hee will be ſo farre from ſpirituall pride and conceitedneſſe, that fearing before Gods mercies, he will be as if he beleeued not that God had heard his voice.</p>

He is a plaine man without fraud and guile in matters of the world, he loues plainneſſe and open dealing, yet he is not ſimple, for in matters of his ſoule he is of great reach, and forecaſt, and diſcretion, &amp;c. 5. He is a bungler in ſinne, he knowes not the methode of Sathan. 6. Hee dotes not vpon the world, he can vſe it as though he vſed it not, hee is not toſſed with diſtracting cares. 7. He cannot abide mixtures in the worſhip of his God, he is neither Idolatrous, nor ſuperſtitious, nor humerous. 8. Good ſucceſſe in grace and innocency, makes him more humble and fit to grieue for ſinne, and feele the waight of it, he ſtruggles as much againſt ſpirituall pride as againſt other ſins. 9. He doth not allow himſelfe to murmure nor repine, either through infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity at God, or through grudging enuy at men, or diſtreſſe himſelfe with vaine feare about how he ſhall doe hereafter. 10. He is harmeleſſe, deſirous ſo to liue as he may wrong none in worldly matters, nor offend any in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. 11.

                  <p>Secondly, it is an inheritance, and ſo ſure.</p>
                  <p>There are foure vſes may be made of this Doctrine. 1. Wee ſhould much loue, eſteeme, and deſire heauen, it is the reward of God. Princes giue great gifts, but Gods leaſt gift muſt needs be glorious. 2. Wee ſhould learne to be liberall as God is liberall, giue freely, giue largely. 3. Here is a plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the merit of heauen, for heauen is an inheritance; now the ſonne doth not inherit the fathers lands, hee hath not his lands in meaſure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſerts, for moſt an end the land is purchaſed before the ſonne be borne; much leſſe can we merit heauen, and the rather becauſe we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge ſo much as this, we came out of the loynes of the father, ſeeing we are children but by adoption.</p>

                  <p>Doctrine from the coherence: That God that promiſeth eternall things, will prouide temporall things alſo. In the former chapter God promiſed the reward of inheritance for ſeruants: here he takes order for their well being in the world, charging maſters to ſee that they be vſed iuſtly and equally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuſt.]</hi> Maſters muſt doe iuſtly, and ſhew it, 1. generally,<note place="margin">Hovv maſters do that vvhich is iuſt.</note> by not requiring vniuſt things of them, and by chuſing ſuch ſeruants as are iuſt into the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6.</note>, leſt by bringing in lewd ſeruants the reſt be infected. For if it be a great iniuſtice to bring in an infectious ſeruant that hath the plague vpon his body, and to appoint him to worke among the reſt of his ſeruants that are free from the diſeaſe, then it is much more vniuſt to bring in lewd ſeruants, that haue the plague ſore of ſinne running vpon them: for the preſence, and counſell, and example of lewd ſinners, is of more power to infect a ſound ſoule, than is a plaguie man to poiſon the ſound body of others. 2. More particularly, maſters muſt doe that which is iuſt, 1. to the ſoules, 2. to the bodies of their ſeruants. They muſt deale iuſtly with their ſoules, by helping them to grace if it be poſſible, but at leaſt by bringing them to the publike meanes of grace, and by priuate training of them vp in Gods feare, by praier and inſtruction. The iuſtice they owe vnto their body may be referred vnto three heads: for either it concernes their maintenance, and ſo they muſt giue them their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of<note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4894:257"/> their open diſorders, as alſo that he will doe it with inſtruction, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to profit them and the whole familie.</p>

                     <hi>Equall.]</hi> Maſters muſt not onely deale iuſtly, but they muſt deale equally with their ſeruants. And maſters deale vnequally many wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When they require inconuenient things: for though the ſeruant muſt obey, yet the maſter ſinnes in requiring vnequall things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they impoſe more worke then they haue ſtrength to doe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When they turne them away when they are ſicke: for it is equall that as thou haſt had their labour when they were well, ſo thou ſhouldeſt keepe them when they are ſicke.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When they reſtraine them of libertie for their ſoules. If thou haue the worke of their bodies, it is equall that thou take care for their ſoules: and if they ſerue thee ſix dayes, it is very equall thou ſhouldeſt proclaime libertie to them to doe Gods worke on the Sabboth day.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When they reſtraine and with-hold their meat and wages.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When they ſend them out of their ſeruice empty, after many yeeres bondage, and not prouide that they may haue ſome meanes to liue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, it is not equall for the maſter to heare euery word that men ſay of his ſeruants<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.23.</note>, nor is it meet they ſhould bring vp their ſeruants deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately<note n="c" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Here are foure Doctrines to be obſerued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is no maſter, but he is a ſeruant; and therefore as hee would require his worke to be done by his ſeruant, ſo hee ſhould be carefull himſelfe to doe Gods worke, to whom he is a ſeruant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Gods maieſtie and mans authoritie may well ſtand together: Chriſt and <hi>Caeſar</hi> can well agree: Mans gouernment in a familie, and Gods gouernment in the world, are not oppoſite one to the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ignorance of God, and the accounts muſt be made to God, is the cauſe of that ſecuritie, inſolencie, and crueltie that is in men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That it is ill to vſe ſeruants ill, it will be required if they be wronged.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That wee muſt pray vpon all occaſions, for health, wealth, ſucceſſe in our callings, preſeruation of our eſtates, the bleſſing of God vpon the word, Sacraments, reading, &amp;c. for pardon of ſinne, ſaluation of our ſoules, euer ſtretching out our deſires to all the opportunities and callings to praier.</p>

                     <hi>Iob</hi> 21.14. Secondly, for reproofe of ſuch as make apoſtacie from the affections and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of praier: and this is a fault in carnall men that fall from temporary faith, or in Gods children, that by the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne and Sathan, giue ouer their affections and carefull diligence in praier. For the firſt ſort, wee muſt know, that when ſuch men loſe their ioy and delight in the word, they loſe alſo their care in praier: but they muſt know they doe it not without ſingular danger; for now that hearing and praier are laid aſide, ſeuen deuils worſe than that one caſt out by acknowledgement, may enter in: yea that they may fall from theſe affections into a reprobate ſenſe; yea, which is worſt, they are in danger of the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and the more if they grow to hate praier and deſpight Gods grace in his children: and therfore they ſhould be aduiſed with all ſpeed to repent with ſound ſorrow, and beſeech God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, if it be poſſible, the thoughts of their hearts. And as for ſuch of Gods children as are decaied and fallen away from the power and practiſe of praier, they ſhould be wakened and remember themſelues, both by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hurt they bring vpon themſelues, and the remedies for their recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The hurts befallen them by this apoſtacie are ſuch as theſe. 1.<note place="margin">The hurts that follovv the apoſtacie from the povver and practiſe of praier.</note> The loſſe of the comforts of the ſweet preſence of God. 2. They put on a kinde of image of the old <hi>Adam</hi> againe, they looke as if they were no better than car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall people, they returne in many things to the filthineſſe they had forſaken, they forme themſelues to the courſes of carnall wiſdome, and too much like the world and the ſinfull profits and pleaſures of it. 3.

                  <p n="1">1. They muſt purge by godly ſorrow and faſting. 2. They muſt labour to reduce themſelues vnto an holy order of liuing, both by a daily courſe of examination by the Law, and alſo by the conſecration of themſelues to the conſtant and orderly practiſe of all Chriſtian duties. 3. They muſt by daily importunitie beſeech God to giue them againe the words and affections of praier: and all this they ſhould doe the more ſpeedily, becauſe if by long dwelling in apoſtacie they prouoke God, though by repentance they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themſelues againe, yet the ioyes of Gods ſpirit, or the great meaſure of them, may be loſt, ſo as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Watching is needfull vnto praier<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.</note>. For explication whereof we muſt know that watching is taken 2. wayes, either literally or metaphorically; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and ſo is either a iudgement or a dutie: watching as a <hi>iudgement,</hi> is when God brings vpon wicked men the terrors of the night, or for chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſeruants, holds their eyes waking. As a <hi>dutie,</hi> watching is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary reſtraining of our eyes from ſleepe, and ſpending of the whole or part of the night in holy imployments. Thus the Church kept the night of the <hi>Paſſeouer</hi> holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. Thus Chriſt watched, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.23.25. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Thus <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 139.18. And this watching vſed by Gods children was either ordinary, or extraordinary: Ordinary watching is nothing but a ſober vſe of ſleepe, in which we ought to be moderate as well as in eating and drinking. Extraordinarily Gods children haue beene vſed to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4894:258"/> watch either vpon occaſion of great iudgements<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Iſay</hi> 26.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.7. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.38.</note>, or for preparation to ſome great buſineſſe. Thus Chriſt would ſpend whole nights in praier; thus hee watched before his paſſion. Or when they haue loſt the benefit of Chriſts preſence, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, and all this they haue done with great ſucceſſe, for <hi>their reines haue taught them in the night</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But it is ſpirituall watchfulneſſe that is here ſpecially required, and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Chriſtian heedfulneſſe, obſeruation, and conſideration, both for preuention of euill, and embracing of the meanes, wayes and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of good. And thus we muſt watch, firſt our owne hearts, to ſpie out where any ſpot of ſpirituall leproſie in thoughts or affections breakes out, to heale it in time. Secondly, the practiſes of Sathan, that wee be not inſnared with his ſpirituall baits and methods. Thirdly, the wayes of God: if any mercy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, or fountaine of grace open, to ſnatch vp our incenſe, and runne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to Gods Altar, and offer with our ſacrifice the <hi>calues of our lips;</hi> or if any threatning arreſt vs, or iudgement befall vs, to make our peace ſpeedily, and flie from the anger to come. Fourthly, the comming of Chriſt either by death or iudgement, ſpecially wee ſhould <hi>watch vpon whom the ends of the world are come</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36.</note>. But that which is here principally meant, is watching vnto praier, and thus we had need to watch, 1. to the meanes to get abilitie to pray, 2. to the opportunitie and occaſions of praier, 3. to the ſucceſſe of it, to take notice of Gods anſwer, and our ſpeeding, waiting vpon God till he giue a bleſſing, or if God hide himſelfe, to ſue out an attonement in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus of watching.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When we haue any ſuits to God for what we want, wee muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully remember to giue thankes for mercies receiued, and particularly for all Gods mercies in praier<note n="p" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. In that the Apoſtle ſo often vrgeth the dutie of thankſgiuing, it ſhewes that naturally we are exceeding vnthankfull for the mercies of God, and that few of vs are carefull to yeeld God conſtantly this ſacrifice.</p>

                  <p>In generall I obſerue three things, 1. That wee ought to pray one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. 2. That one great meanes to get a large heart in prayer, and the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in the practiſe of it, is to endeauour after tender and affectionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to helpe others by prayer. 3. That Chriſtians ſhould deſire the praiers of others, as carnall men make vſe of their friends to get their helpe for wealth, offices &amp;c. So ſhould Chriſtians improoue their intereſt in the affections of their friends by ſeeking praier of them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For vs.]</hi> Here I obſerue 4. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the greateſt in the Church need the praiers of the meaneſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in hearing praier God is no accepter of perſons, hee is as well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> praiers for <hi>Paul,</hi> as heare <hi>Paul</hi> pray for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the dutie of the people to pray for their Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="4">

It is to be obſerued, that he wiſheth them to pray for other Preachers as well as for himſelfe; there may be a ſpirituall pride in deſiring the praiers of others: he did not enuie that others ſhould haue roome in the hearts of others as well as he.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the perſons for whom.</p>
                  <p>The things for which are two wayes to be conſidered: 1. As it is briefly laid downe. 2. As it is more largely explicated.</p>
                  <p>It is laid downe or propounded in theſe words, <hi>that God would open to vs a doore of vtterance,</hi> and is explicated in theſe words that follow, by the ſubiect, reaſon and end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A doore of vtterance.]</hi> There are diuers doores in the Scripture, in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall acceptation of the word. There is the doore</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of admiſſion into the functions of the Church, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.1.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, there is a doore of gifts, as of knowledge, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 8.33. Of faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.27. Of vtterance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. ſo here. The doore of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance comprehends 5. things. 1. Libertie and free paſſage to preach the Goſpell. 2. Opportunitie. 3. Power of preaching. 4. Courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with full vent to rebuke mens ſinnes, and reueale all Gods counſels, without feare of any mans face. 5. Succeſſe, euen ſuch vtterance as will open a doore into the hearts of the hearers: ſo that to pray for the opening of the doore of vtterance, is to pray for libertie, opportunitie, power, courage, and ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> Is firſt for Miniſters, and then for the people. Miniſters may ſee here what it is that ſpecially makes a happie Paſtor; not liuing, countenance of great men, &amp;c. but libertie, courage, power, &amp;c. And it greatly taxeth foure ſorts of Miniſters. 1. Dumbe Miniſters, that vtter nothing. 2. Fantaſticall Miniſters, that vtter the falſhood of their owne braines, that ſpeake their owne dreames, and from the vanitie of their owne hearts, and ſeeke out for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only pleaſing things, dawbing with vntempered morter. 3. Idle Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that vtter not all Gods counſell, for matter or for time, ſpeake but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the people, preach not in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. 4. Cold Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that ſeeke not the power of preaching, ſtriue not to approue themſelues in the ſight of God, and to the conſcience of men.</p>
                  <p>The people alſo ſhould make conſcience of their dutie, they may learne from hence what to pray for, and ſhould daily with importunitie beſeech God to giue this wide doore of vtterance to their Teachers.</p>

                     </gap> for, I muſt note a doctrine lies ſecretly lodged within the ſame: wee may finde in the end of this verſe, that the Apoſtle was in priſon, and yet he doth not deſire to haue the doore of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4894:259"/> priſon open, but the doore of his heart open to vtter the myſterie of Chriſt, noting that it is a greater want to want the libertie of his miniſterie, in reſpect of vtterance, then it is to want the libertie of his body in reſpect of the priſon. We ſhould take notice of this for diuers vſes: 1. For thankfulneſſe, if there be a doore of vtterance opened in Gods houſe. 2. For preuention of all things (as much as lieth in vs) that might ſtop the mouthes of Gods faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. There are fiue things that ſtop the mouthes of Miniſters in generall: 1. Ignorance and preſumptuous ſinnes in the Miniſters themſelues;<note place="margin">Fiue things ſtop the mouthes of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> for pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted lips are no lips of vtterance: the lips of the Miniſter ſhould be touched with the coales of knowledge, zeale, and mortification. 2. The ſinnes of the people many times put the Teachers to ſilence: the rebellion of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made <hi>Ezechiel</hi> dumbe, that he could not preach, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.26.24.27. 3.

                     <hi>Euen vnto vs.]</hi> This manner of ſpeech notes either his humilitie, or his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint in priſon, or the difficultie of vtterance. His humilitie it may note in this ſenſe, that howſoeuer he hath beene a blaſphemer, or a perſecutor, &amp;c. yet that God would be pleaſed to honour him and his worke ſo much, as giue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance euen to him and ſuch as he is. His reſtraint in priſon it may import al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and ſo his deſire is they ſhould not pray onely for Miniſters that were at large, and enioyed peace, but alſo euen for him and ſuch others as were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for a godly Preacher will not be idle, no not if he come into priſon: and thus alſo it notes, that the wiſeſt men of themſelues are not able to teach with power and profit the ſimpleſt and meaneſt men; an Apoſtle cannot teach a priſoner, without Gods ſpeciall aid and bleſſing. Theſe words may note alſo the difficultie of vtterance, as if he ſhould ſay, you had need to pray not only for ordinary, but extraordinary Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the thing praied for, as it is briefly propounded. Secondly, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, 1. by the ſubiect, 2. by a reaſon, 3. by the end.</p>
                  <p>The ſubiect of the vtterance is the myſterie of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſpeake the myſterie of Chriſt.]</hi> Chriſt is a myſterie to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Hovv Chriſt is a myſterie to 6. ſorts of men.</note> to the Iewes, to Heretikes, to Papiſts, to carnall men, yea to godly men. It is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie to the Gentiles that there ſhould be a Sauiour: To the Iewes, that ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be in the Carpenters ſonne: To the Papiſts, that he ſhould be the Sauiour alone: To the Heretikes, that hee ſhould be a Sauiour in both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: To the carnall man, that he ſhould be a Sauiour in particular to him: And to the godly man, that he ſhould be ſuch a Sauiour.</p>
                  <p>But to expreſſe this more particularly, Chriſt is a myſterie fiue wayes:<note place="margin">Chriſt a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie 5 vvaies.</note> for there are myſteries</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:4894:260"/>1. In the perſon of Chriſt: for what tongue can deſcribe the ſuperceleſtiall vnion of his natures, or the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, or the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Godhead that dwels in him bodily?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In his life and death. The world could not comprehend the bookes that might be made of the wonders of his birth, life, and death. We may ſee in that that is written what to adore; for in this world a perfect knowledge we ſhall neuer attaine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In his body, which is the Church: for who can declare his generation? or expreſſe the ſecrets of his power and preſence, in filling her, who himſelfe is her fulneſſe, and filleth all in all things? or deſcribe the manner of the vnion betweene Chriſt and his members? Is not this a great myſterie?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Sacraments of Chriſt. The holy inuiſible preſence of God is a myſterie: the communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt, not locally or by <hi>contact,</hi> and yet truly, is a myſterie: the ſeale of the holy ſpirit of promiſe vpon the hearts of beleeuers, in the due vſe of the Sacraments, is a myſterie: the ſpirituall nouriſhment that comes to the ſoule by ſuch ſecret and hidden paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages inuiſibly, is a great myſterie.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the Goſpell of Chriſt. And by the myſterie of Chriſt in this place I thinke is meant the Goſpell of Chriſt: and it is called a myſterie becauſe of the hiding of it. If you aske me where the Goſpell hath beene hidden, I muſt anſwer,<note place="margin">The Goſpell hidden fiue vvayes.</note> it hath beene hidden, 1. in the breaſt of God from all eternitie: 2. in the ſhadowes and types of the ceremoniall Law, which was the Iewes Goſpell: 3. in the treaſurie of holy Scriptures: 4. in the perſon, obedience, and paſſion of Chriſt, who was the ſubſtance of the Moſaicall ceremonies, and the quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence of all Euangelicall doctrine: 5. in the hearts of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>If you aske me from whom it was hidden; I anſwer, not from the elect, for God by preaching reuealed it vnto them in due time; but from wicked men, but with great difference:<note place="margin">The Goſpell hidden from the vvicked diuerſly.</note> for to ſome there is no Goſpell at all giuen, as to the Gentile; to ſome not giuen plainly, as in thoſe congregations of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom this euangelicall loafe is not diuided, though in the whole lumpe it bee giuen: to ſome not giuen in the power of it, for though they heare the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, yet by reaſon of mixtures, carnall wiſdome, or ignorance, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe in the Teachers, there is little power in it: to ſome not giuen inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, though externally they haue meanes in the plentie and power of it.</p>

                  <p>Here are two things I will but briefly touch: 1. That a Chriſtian ſhould be more carefull how he behaues himſelfe before wicked men then before godly men. 2. It is to be noted that he ſaith not with them, but towards them;<note place="margin">Note.</note> it is one thing to walke with them, and another thing to walke towards them: the one notes a voluntary conſorting with them, this the Apoſtle allowes not; the other notes a behauiour that is well framed when through neceſſitie and calling we muſt haue to doe with them.</p>
                  <p>But the maine thing is,<note place="margin">The rules of conuerſing in reſpect of vvicked men.</note> what wee muſt doe that wee may carry our ſelues iuſtly towards wicked men. That this may be diſtinctly vnderſtood, wicked men may be two wayes conſidered; firſt, as ſpectators of our conuerſation: ſecondly, as parties in conuerſing.</p>
                  <p>As they are ſpectators and obſerue vs, there are 4. things which in godly diſcretion we ſhould make to ſhine before them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All good faithfulneſſe in our calling, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.11.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1.</p>

                  <p>As they are parties in conuerſing, they are two wayes to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As they are euill men, but not iniurious and euill to vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As they are both euill men and iniurious to vs.</p>
                  <p>Towards the firſt ſort our wiſdome of conuerſation muſt be ſhewed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the due obſeruation of the circumſtances of lawfull things, for all lawfull things are not to be done at all times, and in all companies, and in all manners, indiſcretion herein doth much harme euery where.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the skilfull applying of our ſelues to winne them, making vſe of all opportunities, and ſpeaking to them with all reuerence, deliberation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, inſtance, &amp;c. as may become the maieſtie of Gods truth and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the ſhunning of conceitedneſſe, peruerſeneſſe, frowardneſſe, and ſuch like things, as doe maruellouſly prouoke a carnall minde, but approue our ſelues in all meekneſſe <hi>of wiſdome.</hi> It is a great wiſdome in the vſe of our knowledge, to expreſſe a conſtant meekneſſe, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In auoiding euill, 1. to them, 2. to our ſelues. To walke wiſely in auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euils to them, is to be carefull that we put no <hi>ſtumbling blocke before the blinde,</hi> but cut off all occaſions of reproaching or blaſpheming. In auoiding
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4894:262"/> euill to our ſelues by them, we muſt looke to three things: 1. That we be not infected or defiled by their company, either by needleſſe preſence, or by any kinde of conſent to, or approbation of their euils. 2. That we be not beguiled by committing our ſelues to them, and truſting faire pretences, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.24. 3. That wee yeeld not to them to ſatisfie them in the leaſt ſinne; for tis not yeelding will draw them, but <hi>a pure conuerſation with feare,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Towards the ſecond ſort of wicked men, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are euill, and are or are like to be iniurious to vs, our wiſdome of conuerſation lieth in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a wiſe demeaning of our ſelues when they doe wrong or perſecute vs, ſhewing all firmneſſe and vndaunted conſtancie, patience, reuerence, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, clemencie, and good conſcience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.14.15.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a diſcreet preuention of our owne trouble as neere as wee can. This wiſdome <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhewed in his dealing with his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> when hee came out againſt him with foure hundred men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. And <hi>Samuel,</hi> when hee went to anoint <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. And <hi>Huſhai</hi> when he ſaluted <hi>Abſolon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.15.

It hath not in it a forſaking of fidelitie in the diſcharge of our duties. <hi>Amos</hi> muſt not leaue the Court, though <hi>Amaziah</hi> tell him it is his wiſeſt way. <hi>Michaiah</hi> muſt not flatter <hi>Ahab</hi> becauſe the 400. Prophets did. Laſtly, to walke wiſely is not to walke craftily and deceitfully; for ſuch wiſdome of Serpents is required, as may ſtand with the innocencie of Doues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Redeeme the time.]</hi> To redeeme ſignifies either to recouer what is loſt, or to buy what is wanting. It is vſually a metaphor borrowed from Merchants buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling of commodities. <hi>Time</hi> ſignifies either ſpace of time, or the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of time: both may be here retained.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Six things obſerued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the redeeming of time.</note>In generall, as time is taken for ſpace of time, there are diuers things may be obſerued. 1. That time is a commoditie. 2. That a Chriſtian is a Merchant by calling. 3. That as any are more wiſe, the more they know the worth of time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15.16. 4. That a Chriſtian findes the want of time. 5. That if he were prouident, time for holy duties might be bought. 6. Not to trade for time is a great fault, and yet an vſuall fault, and comes to paſſe becauſe men haue no ſtocke of grace to imploy, or they haue neuer ſerued a prentiſhip to learne how to vſe time, or elſe they haue had ſuch extraordinary loſſes, they cannot ſet vp againe; they haue ſo often made ſhipwracke of time by miſſe-ſpending it, that they cannot now well ſet themſelues in a courſe to vſe it well.</p>

                  <p>In particular, concerning redeeming of time, conſider 1. what time is loſt, 2. how time is to be redeemed, 3. how it muſt be vſed when it is redeemed, 4. the vſes.</p>

                  <p>For the ſecond, wee muſt diſtinguiſh of times, and the perſons that haue time to ſell, and the kindes of redeeming. There is time paſt: this cannot be brought backe againe by any price, but yet wee may contract with time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for ſome allowance towards the loſſe of time paſt. There is alſo time to come. And here is firſt a time of glory to come,<note place="margin">Hovv time may bee bought againe.</note> and a great bargaine to be made: and for the buying of this, heauen muſt ſuffer violence, and we ſhould throng and crowde into the market to procure it, by praier, hearing, faith, almeſdeeds, &amp;c. For though it be onely Chriſts merits that deſerues it, yet theſe things we muſt doe for the aſſurance of it. Beſides, there is a time of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes to come: as ſure as we haue had our dayes of ſinne, we ſhall haue dayes of ſorrow and torment. This time is to be bought out with repentance, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, faſting, praying, ſtrong cries, by all meanes endeuouring to make our peace, and flie from the anger to come.</p>
                  <p>But time preſent is the commoditie we are with all carefulneſſe to redeeme. The deuill and the world haue time, our callings haue time, and God is a great Lord of time. Time out of the deuils hands and the worlds muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by violent ablation: time from our callings we muſt redeeme by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation only, making an exchange, and allowing time for godlineſſe. In the firſt and chiefe place, time of God we muſt buy, both the ſpace of time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in, and the opportunitie of time, both for the giuing, and the efficacie of the meanes: and for this we muſt both offer and tender the ſacrifice of Chriſt, to pacifie for time loſt, and procure acceptation; and alſo wee muſt offer vp our ſelues, ſoules and bodies, vpon the ſeruice of opportunities, humbling our ſoules to walke with our God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When wee haue bought time, wee muſt be carefull to vſe it well:<note place="margin">Hovv time muſt be vſed vvhen it is bought.</note> and herein a principall reſpect is to be had vnto the ſoule; for all this merchandiſe is for the vſe of the ſoule eſpecially, and for religious ends. And thus we muſt ſpend ſome time in mortification, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1.2. and ſome part in ſearching the Scriptures, leſt that be ſaid of vs which was ſaid of the Iewes, that whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time they might haue beene teachers, they did need againe to be taught the very principles, they were ſo inexpert in the word of righteouſnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. Much time ſhould be ſpent in the workes of pietie, abounding in the worke of the Lord as wee abound in time. Some time ſhould be ſpent in workes of mercy, both ſpirituall (inſtructing, comforting, exhorting, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:4894:263"/> &amp;c. and corporall, (in feeding, clothing viſiting, &amp;c.) Generally our time ſhould be ſpent in well-doing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. And as for time for world buſineſſes, we ſhould obſerue the Apoſtles rule: <hi>They that haue wiues ſhould be as they that haue none, and they that weepe as though they wepe not, and they that reioyce as though they reioyced not, and they that buy as though they poſſed not, and they that vſe the world as though they vſed it not, for the faſhion of the world goeth away,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 29.30.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of all is for reproofe of the moſt of vs: for ſome of vs ſinne againſt the ſeaſons and opportunities of Gods grace, ſome againſt the very ſpace of time. Men tranſgreſſe againſt opportunitie two waies; firſt, by ignorance of the ſignes of the ſeaſons, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.3. ſecondly, by a wilfull neglect of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of grace when we haue them. There are many things might moue vs to redeeme the time in this reſpect.<note place="margin">Motiues to redeeme time.</note> 1. We haue our times appointed, and the bounds of our habitation aſſigned, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. 2. The times will not bee alwaies faier; there are perillous times, times of ſorrow, anguiſh, ſicknes, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, want, loſſe, feare, perplexitie, yea wee may purpoſe, promiſe, expect time of healing and curing, when we ſhall be deceiued, and finde a time of trouble, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.19. Beſides, Chriſt in the opportunities of grace is but a litle while with men. There is a prime of mans life, yea a prime of euery mans miniſterie, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.33. Further, the kingdome of God in the mercies of it may be wholly taken away, if we bring not fruit in time of fruit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.34.41. Laſtly, this is a very prouoking ſinne: for if God giue a ſpace to repent, and men will not know the day of their viſitation, moſt an end God caſts ſuch into a bed of affliction, after they haue ſtretched themſelues vpon the bed of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritite, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.21.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.43.44. Yea many of Gods children are greatly to blame, in neglecting the opportunities of aſſurance of grace: and therefore becauſe they are ſo careleſſe in making their calling and election ſure, this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of the promiſe of God, is ſcourged afterwards with comfortleſſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, ariſing from ſuch a ſenſe of their corruptions, as makes them for a long time ſeeme to be depriued of all grace and mercy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                  <p>Againe, many men ſinne egregiouſly againſt the very ſpace of time, in that they haue much leiſure and time, and fill it vp with litle or no good imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their eſtate, that haue meanes to liue without labour is vſually accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an eſtate of great eaſe and happineſſe. But in deed it is an eſtate of much danger: for the men that abound in time without imploiment, are liable to many temptations and luſts; beſides, they are ſubiect to almoſt continuall hardneſſe of heart and deadnſſe of ſpirit: for it is the labouring ſeruant that enters into his maſters ioy. Adde that men that abound with leaſure, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily drawne by the inticements of ill company, and much intangled with the ſports and pleaſures of the world. Sometimes ſuch perſons grow into great habit of ſuſpitiouſneſſe, waiwardneſſe, filled with wordly paſſions and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments: ſometimes they prooue great medlers in other folkes buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>The remedie for theſe perſons, whether men or women, is to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſome kinde of profitable imployment, and to labour ſo as ſome way to ſee the fruit of it, to eat their owne bread; but eſpecially they ſhould bee abundant in the worke of the Lord, they ſhould double their imployment in reading, hearing, conference, mortification, mercy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus of wiſe conuerſation.</p>

                  <p>In generall we ſo heare that we muſt looke to our words aſwell as our workes, and therefore they are farre wide that ſay, <hi>their tongues are their owne who ſhall controule them, Pſal.</hi> 12.4.</p>
                  <p>From Coherence I obſerue, that he walkes not wiſely that talkes not wiſely, for euill words corrupt good manners, neither may he be accounted an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man of life that is an euill man in tongue.</p>
                  <p>The vſe is for tryall, for if God make vs new creatures, he giues vs new tongues, and if he turne the people to him by true repentance,<note place="margin">Note.</note> he doth <hi>returne vnto them a pure language, Zeph.</hi> 3.9. and therefore <hi>if any man ſeemeth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and refraineth not his tongue, this man religion is in vaine.</hi>

                     <hi>Let]</hi> It is not arbitrarie (we may looke to our words if we will) but it is a flat precept, and ſo a matter indiſpenſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your]</hi> God is no reſpecter of perſons, he forbids vngracious, wanton, and idle words, in Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, aſwell as in poore men and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers; he diſlikes it in Maſters and Parents, aſwell as in children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, it is as ill for the Maſter to ſpend his time in idle talke &amp;c. as for the ſeruant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gracious]</hi> Our words may be ſaid to be gracious three waies.<note place="margin">Obſeruations concerning gracious ſpeech.</note> 1. If we reſpect the cauſe. 2. If we reſpect the ſubiect. 3. If we reſpect the effect. In reſpect of the cauſe good words are well ſaid to be gracious, Firſt, becauſe they flow from the free grace of God without our merit: for wee doe not deſerue ſo much as to be truſted with one good word. Reaſon yeelds vs conceits, and nature an inſtrument to ſpeake by,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but it is the God of nature that of his free grace giues vs good words. Secondly, our words ought to proceed from ſome grace of God in the heart, as from knowledge, faith, ioy, ſorrow, loue, feare, deſire, &amp;c. and in this ſenſe when they are in the tongue, carry ſtill the name of the fountaine whence they flow. Againe, our words muſt be gracious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſubiect, the matter we muſt talke of, muſt be of good things, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters, words of inſtruction, comfort, faith, hope &amp;c. but eſpecially our words ſhould be ſeaſoned with the daily memorie and mention of Gods grace to vs in Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.21.</note>. Thirdly, our words ought to be gracious in reſpect of the effect ſuch as tend to build vp and miniſter grace to the hearers<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29.</note>, yea gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words are faire words, and faire words are firſt gracefull words, words of thankfulnes. 2. Inoffenſiue words, not railing, bitter, ſlandering, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or filthy words, nay not ieſting words that are intended to prouoke, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, diſgrace and bite. 3. Seaſonable words<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>Vſe is for reproofe. And men ſinne againſt this exhortation, 1. by omiſſion of gracious words. But ſecondly they doe worſe that vſe euill words.

                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6.</note>. But they are worſt of all that loue euill words, euen the words that may deſtroy either their owne ſoules, or the ſoules of others. 2. Here is inſtruction, we muſt labour by all meanes, to get abilitie for a gracious ſpeech, either to God by prayer, or to men in conuerſing with them: And to this end, firſt we muſt pray conſtantly and conſcionably to God, to giue vs gracious words. Secondly, we muſt get the law of grace into our hearts<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30, 31.</note>, yea we ſhould ſtriue to be examples one to another, not onely in faith, and conuerſation, but in words alſo<note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</note>; and if all Chriſtians are charged to vſe gracious ſpeeches, much more Miniſters, they ſhould ſpeake the words of God, they ſhould keep the patterne of wholeſome words, and ſtay all vaine bablings which increaſe to more vngodlineſſe, and all words that fret as a canker. Thus of the firſt propertie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Powdred with ſalt]</hi> Theſe are termes borrowed either from the vſe of the Temple, or from common and ciuill vſe. In the Temple euery ſacrifice was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4894:264"/> ſalted with ſalt,<note place="margin">Mark. <hi>9.</hi> vlt.</note> ſo muſt euery Chriſtian (who is Gods ſacrifice) be ſeaſoned. In the common life of man, meats that are to be kept long, muſt be powdred with ſalt, to drinke vp or dry out corruption, and to preſerue ſauour, ſo muſt a Chriſtian be ſeaſoned that will be kept to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>But firſt here is implied that the words of men are naturally corrupt, rotten, vnſauorie, and haue great neede of ſeaſoning. The carnall mans words are much after the humor and infection of his minde. The talke of the Couetous is vſually of his mammon, farme, oxen, bargaines, wares, &amp;c. The Epicures talke is vſually of his ſports, dogges, cockes, horſes, games, companions, or of his luſts.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The Superſtitious man talkes of his Dagon, or the ſignes of heauen. The Wrathfull man of his aduerſarie and wrong. The Ambitious man of his liuings, honors, offices, offers, hopes, or his owne parts and praiſes. To conclude, the talke of all naturall men is but of naturall things, and as they are of the fleſh, ſo their talke ſauours nothing but fleſhly things.</p>

There is the ſalt of diſcretion, and this is the praiſe of the wiſe; none of theſe three may be here excluded from our word. For firſt we muſt receiue lawes for our lips, euen from Gods miniſters. We muſt learne of them not onely how to order our affections and life, but alſo how to ſpeake, eſpecially in matters of God and godlineſſe. Secondly, we muſt mourne for the ſins of the tongue aſwell as for other ſins: we muſt driue out the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that cleaues to our words with the ſalt of mortification.

They muſt not faile to mourne ouer their offences in ſpeech, in ſecret till they haue ſubdued them, afflicting themſelues with voluntarie ſorrowes for them. 3. They muſt ſtriue by all meanes to accuſtome themſelues in good ſpeech, and gracious words; yea many profeſſors are to be reproued for their words, for many times they are either too many, or too vaine and idle, or too falſe, or too raſh &amp;c.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4894:264"/> as when hee comes newly from the Sermon, or on the Sabboth day, not onely in ſome companies, or in ſome arguments, but at all times, and in all places, watching to all the oportunities to glorifie God, or profit others by his words. Thus of the precept.</p>
                  <p>The end followes, <hi>that yee may know how to anſwer euery one.</hi> In generall I obſerue here two things: Firſt, that by ſpeaking well we learne to ſpeake well. Secondly, that the ſoundeſt knowledge is experimentall; he doth not indeede know how to anſwer, that doth not in practiſe exerciſe himſelfe in gracious words, though he had all places of anſwer and arguments in his head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To anſwer]</hi> To anſwer doth not alwaies import a queſtion or demand go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, but is ſometimes taken for continuing to ſpeake, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. it is ſaid our Sauiour anſwered, and yet no demand went before: Some thinke it is a part for the whole, and one vſe of words put for all vſes: but I take it in the ordinarie ſenſe, as the word vſually imports, and ſo we anſwer either vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers or beleeuers: concerning our chriſtian anſwer before vnbeleeuers there are ſix things may be here obſerued.<note place="margin">Six things concerning anſvvering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers.</note>

                  <p>In theſe words and thoſe that follow is conteined the ſecond part of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4894:265"/> concluſion. Before he hath handled the common doctrine both of faith and life, now he lets looſe his affection to expreſſe in particular his loue to ſpeciall Chriſtians: In all the words there is to be obſerued, firſt, a narration as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſecondly, the ſalutations themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The narration is in theſe three verſes, and the ſumme of it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> being priſoner at Rome, to expreſſe his care for and loue to the Church, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the Coloſſians, ſends <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> the one a Miniſter, the other a priuate man, both faithfull, to ſhew them of <hi>Pauls</hi> affaires, and to viſit the Churches and comfort them.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the particulars, from the generall conſideration of all the verſes to the end of the Chapter, theſe foure things may be obſerued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That religion extends it ſelfe to the behauiour of men, euen in theſe more ordinarie matters of life, ſo as men may ſinne or obey euen in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the loue euen of the beſt Chriſtians needs (for the preſeruing and continuing of it) euen theſe lighter helps and obſeruances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That piety is no enemy to curteſie, it doth not remoue but rectifie it: Piety doth preſcribe to curteſie foure waies, 1. By forbidding and reſtrayning the arte of diſſimulation, and the politike ſeruing of mens humors, and all the baſe courſes of flattery. 2. By moderating the exceſſe of complements. 3. By preſeruing the puritie of them, that they be not made the inſtruments of prophaneneſſe, and pollution, and wantonneſſe. 4. By adding to them the ſeedes of grace and religion, <hi>Paul</hi> will ſalute aſwell as the Gentiles, but yet his matter ſhall tend vnto grace and ſome good of the ſoule, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. and in the reſt of the Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Amongſt Chriſtians there may be a preheminence of affection, ſome may beloued more then others; the Apoſtle is deſirous his doctrine may be a teſtimonie of his loue to all, but yet he cannot forbeare the mention of his ſpeciall reſpect of ſome.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing in this part of the concluſion is the narration, and out of the whole narration theſe things may be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The generall care Miniſters ſhould haue of the Churches, <hi>Paul</hi> cares for the Churches farre remoued, yea when himſelfe is in great trouble, and ſo it might be thought, he had cauſe enough of care for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the affections betweene faithfull Miniſters and the people ſhould not onely be conceiued but expreſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Church-gouernours ſhould be carefull whom they imploy in the buſineſſes of the Church, <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſend a letter, but makes choice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and faithfull men, much leſſe would he haue imploied about the worſhip of God or the cenſures of the Church, ſuſpitious perſons, men of ill fame, drunkards, or of ſcandalous behauiour: How can it be otherwiſe but that the graue cenſures of the Church ſhould be loathed, and ſcorned, when ſuch numbers of diſordered and prophane perſons are admitted to the denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, pleading, and executing of them?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men ſhould be carefull how and whom they commend by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; to commend euill men is to beare falſe witneſſe, many times to the great hurt both of the Church and common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt particular thing in the narration concerning <hi>Tichicus,</hi> is his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Here I obſerue,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who commends him, <hi>viz: Paul.</hi> And this ſhewes that Miniſters ſhould be carefull to preſerue and inlarge the credits of their brethren. Eſpecially this is a care ſhould be in ſuch as excell others in place or gifts. They are farre from this, that detract from the iuſt praiſes of their brethren, hold them downe with all diſgrace, labour to deſtroy what they build vp, and plucke away the affections of the people from them; and when they haue occaſion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4894:265"/> to ſpeake to them, vſe them contemptibly, and rate them as if they were rather their ſcullions then their brethren. And the ſinne is the worſe, when the ſame perſons can countenance idle, euill, and ſcandalous perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To what end, <hi>viz:</hi> That his embaſſage might be ſo much the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected: for the credit of the perſon winnes much reſpect to the doctrine it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In what manner. And here obſerue two things: 1. That he giues him his full praiſe: for a man may ſlander by ſpeaking ſparingly in the praiſes of the well-deſeruing. 2. That he praiſeth him without any <hi>(but)</hi> to teach vs that we ſhould not be eaſie in word or letter in diſcouering the infirmities of faithfull Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The particulars of his praiſes. And they may be diuided thus: Either they are common to all true Chriſtians, <hi>(beloued brother);</hi> or proper to Church-officers, and that either in relation to Chriſt, <hi>(a faithfull miniſter),</hi> or in relation to <hi>Paul, (a fellow-ſeruant.</hi>

                     </note>)</p>
                  <p>There are foure things ought to be in euery good Miniſter.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He muſt be a good man, <hi>a brother.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. He ſhould be beloued of his people, <hi>beloued brother.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. He muſt be faithfull. And his faithfulneſſe ſtands in two things: 1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in labour: 2. Sinceritie in giuing euery one their portion of rebukes, comforts, directions, &amp;c. in due ſeaſon.</item>
                     <item>4. He muſt be a fellow-ſeruant, one that will draw in the yoke with his brethren.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This may ſmite the conſcience of many ſorts of Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Some becauſe they are of wicked and ſcandalous life.</p>
                  <p>Some becauſe they haue made themſelues hatefull to their people by their indiſcretion, couetouſneſſe, contention, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some becauſe they are not faithfull: Either not true to the bed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to which they conſecrated themſelues: or not ſincere in the vſe of their gifts, being idle loiterers, indiſcreet feeders, men-pleaſers, or the like.</p>
                  <p>Some becauſe they are proud, humorous, ſelfe-conceited, ſingular, and loue to goe alone.</p>
                  <p>Thus of his praiſes. The ends of his miſſion followes, and they are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might declare vnto them <hi>Pauls</hi> eſtate. 2. That he might know their eſtate. 3. That he might comfort their hearts.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: If you aske what he ſhould declare, I may anſwer, ſuch things as theſe, the ſucceſſe of the Goſpell in <hi>Rome,</hi> the order of <hi>Pauls</hi> life, and his afflictions.</p>
                  <p>If you aske to what end: I anſwer, 1. For approbation; the greateſt men neede the approbation of other Miniſters, yea of other Chriſtians. 2. For thankſgiuing, that ſo many praiſes might be giuen to God. 3. For praier for what was wanting, or hurtfull to him or the Church. 4. For conſolation to them, who queſtionleſſe would reioyce to heare from <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, it is to be noted, that he ſaith, his whole eſtate: for a godly man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelfe ſo as he cares not though all men ſee into all his courſes.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe ſtate of the people ought to be knowne to the Miniſter:<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> not their worldly eſtate, but the eſtate of their ſoules, &amp; conſciences, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the meanes vpon them, not onely for the ſatisfaction of the Miniſters affection, but for the guiding of his priuate preparations and praiers, and for his publike doctrine.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4894:266"/> in reſpect of preaching: neither can he be a good preacher, that is not a carefull Watchman.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is a great defect in the people, when the miniſter wants intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For though it be a baſe humour of any to bring falſe reports, and a weake part in any miniſter to make the pulpit a place to vent their priuate and perſonall buſineſſes, yet in the generall he cannot be a good Phyſitian to the ſtate of any congregation, that is not acquainted with their diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why doth the Apoſtle ſend to know their eſtate?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he would not credit reports concerning them: for he knew that wicked men out of their malice would raiſe monſtrous ſlanders many times of the beſt deſeruing people: and beſides, the better ſort of men are not carefull of their words in reports; matters grow with telling, and euery man according to his ſeuerall affection ſets a ſeuerall <hi>emphaſis</hi> vpon the matter he tels, ſo that after a while the tale will not be worth receiuing. This carefulnes ſhould teach vs how to heare, eſpecially we ſhould be warie, and well aduiſed, and thorowly informed, before, by praier and faſting we take vp the name of God concerning the abſent.</p>
                  <p>The third end is, <hi>that their hearts might be comforted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here in generall from the Apoſtles care to haue them comforted, obſerue,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſtians neede comfort and incouragement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That comfort is the peculiar portion of true Chriſtians; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, nothing but ſorrow and the curſe is the portion of wicked men; and if any dramme of comfort be applied to wicked men, the truth of God is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But this is the way to make them deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The blinde and dreaming world is miſtaken. Giue mee an inſtance of one man in this place, nay in this age, nay in any age, (that I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) ſhew me any example in Scripture, or any inſtance in experience, of one ſoule driuen into deſpaire by the ſincere preaching of the word: It is no great thing I deſire.<note place="margin">Note.</note> That men haue deſpaired I know and finde, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> did; but that it was ſeuere preaching that wrought it, I no where finde: and yet for one bitter word giuen by vs, the Prophets gaue ten, and yet this euent neuer followed. Not but there is enough ſaid many times to make deſpaire, but that there is this prouidence of God, that it comes not vpon men by this meanes; but either of the melancholy of the body, or the ſpeciall curſe that God priuately powred vpon them, or by the ſpeciall working of Satan by Gods iuſt permiſſion. And yet I allow not indiſcreet raſhnes, or rude indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in applying threatnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That it is the dutie of euery Miniſter to labour to build vp Gods children in comfort, as the Apoſtle doth herein expreſſe his care. But yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whom the Apoſtle comforts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as had the faith of Ieſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4. 2. Such as loued all the Saints, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.1. 3. Such as were fruitfull hearers of the Goſpell, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. 4. Such as were conſtant, and laboured to bee grounded in faith and hope, <hi>Col:</hi> 1.23. 5.

Such as were circumciſed with circumciſion made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, and haue put away the body of ſinnes, and had with painefull ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes put away, fornication, vncleaneneſſe, the inordinate affection, wrath, anger, malice, curſed ſpeaking, filthy ſpeaking and lying out of their mouths, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.5.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A queſtion may be here asked, whether conſolations doe barre out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes and directions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They doe not, for <hi>Paul</hi> doth comfort, and yet he rebuked in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, and directed in the third; nay many times rebukes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4894:266"/> are great doores of conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Thus of <hi>Pauls</hi> care to haue them comforted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tichicus</hi> did comfort their hearts, 1. by his preſence. 2. by bringing letters to the Church from <hi>Paul.</hi> 3. by his words, not of report onely, relating <hi>Pauls</hi> eſtate to them, but of doctrine, perſwading them to patience vnder their croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, remembring them of the ioyes to come, ſtrengthning them againſt the gaine-ſayings of aduerſaries, the temptations of Satan, the rebellion of their owne fleſh, and the inconuenience of <hi>Pauls</hi> impriſonment, and laſtly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them how to goe on in holy life.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt part of the narration.</p>
                  <p>In the narration concerning <hi>Oneſimus</hi> I obſerue two things: his praiſes, and the end of his miſſion. His praiſes are as they ſtand in relation to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or in particular to them; to all, he is <hi>a brother, faithfull,</hi> beloued to them, and ſo he is <hi>one of them:</hi> the end of his miſſion is in the end of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oneſimus]</hi> This <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was the theeuiſh and fugitiue ſeruant of <hi>Philemon,</hi> who comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> was conuerted by <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon, and is now for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſake ſent with <hi>Tichicus.</hi> From hence diuers things may be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That hatefull and vnfaithfull perſons may be conuerted, and made worthy, faithfull, and beloued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That religion and the word doth not marre, but make good ſeruants. The word will doe that which rating and ſtripes will not doe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That no mans ſinnes, of which they haue repented before God and the Church, ought to be charged vpon them as any diſparagement in ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent times. Where God forgiues, men ſhould not impute.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a good worke, to grace and credit ſuch as by repentance returne from their former euill waies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Repentance and true grace is the ſureſt way to credit: the beſt way to lift reproch from a mans name, is to get ſinne off his ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Now in the particular praiſe of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> I obſerue: Firſt, that Chriſtian loue reſpects not perſons: <hi>Paul</hi> is not aſhamed of a poore ſeruant, and he would haue the Church loue whom God loues. Secondly, that there is faithfulneſſe required of priuate men as well as Miniſters, and that faithfulneſſe ſtands in three things, ſoundneſſe in religion without error or hypocriſie, diligence in the particular calling, and fidelitie in promiſes and couenants. Thirdly, that naturall and ciuill relations are not broken or diſabled by religion; they muſt not onely loue <hi>Oneſimus</hi> as a Chriſtian, but alſo as <hi>one of them,</hi> for he was a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Coloſſe:</hi> there is loue ſhould be in men as they are fellow-citizens, and of the ſame trade or profeſſion, or the like.</p>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4894:267"/> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> conuerted by <hi>Paul,</hi> who out of the deereneſſe of his reſpect, would neuer leaue him, but accompanied him in his aduerſities; for he was taken with him in the tumult at <hi>Epheſus</hi>

But here we ſee that aduerſitie doth not leſſen that affection that is ſound, either to God or to Gods people: they that cannot endure the ſmiting of the tongue, would litle endure the yron fetters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marcus</hi> is the ſecond. This is he about whom the contention was betweene <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 13. becauſe he had forſaken them, and the labour of preaching with them. Now he is commended by his alliance to <hi>Barnabas:</hi> Certainly the kindred of worthy men are to be regarded euen for their ſakes, much more their poſteritie. It is a great fault, that when men haue ſpent themſelues in the labour and ſeruice of the Church, their poſteritie ſhould be neglected, and expoſed to want and miſery. And is it a credit to be <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſiſters ſonne? What is it then to be the childe of God by regeneration?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning whom you haue receiued commandment]</hi> Some thinke that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> brought to them the decrees of the Counſell at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and theſe read it <hi>(of whom yee receiued &amp;c.)</hi> Some ſay the meaning hereof is not reuealed, and therefore they will not inquire. Some thinke, that vpon his forſaking of the Apoſtle, the Churches had notice not to receiue him if he came vnto them, and that he had written to them himſelfe. Some thinke the latter words <hi>(whom receiue)</hi> are an explication, and ſo they ſhew what was commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> to receiue him.</p>
                  <p>Now for the obſeruations we may note: Firſt, that ſcandalous perſons are not to be receiued. Secondly, that the greatneſſe of the offences of men are not to be meaſured by carnall reaſon, but by the conſideration of the perſon, manner, place, time, &amp;c. A leſſer offence aggrauated by circumſtances may giue cauſe of priuate ſeparation from voluntarie company. Thirdly, that an ingenuous nature is much affected with the diſtaſte of diſcreet Chriſtians. Fourthly, that repenting ſinners are to be receiued, if vnto Gods mercy, then much more vnto our houſes and companies. It is an ill qualitie to be hard to be reconciled. In generall tis our dutie and Gods commandement, that we ſhould receiue one another<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.7.</note>. Thus Miniſters muſt receiue their people, when they are with them, to ſpeake to them of the kingdome of God<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <p>Now becauſe this point of receiuing one another is exceeding needfull, and there may be much miſtaking about it, I thinke good therefore to giue out of ſeuerall Scriptures rules how we are to carry our ſelues in this buſineſſe of receiuing one another.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Six rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note>1. That we entertaine with all heedfulneſſe, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 9. in <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, and <hi>Act.</hi> 18.27. in <hi>Apollos</hi> caſe. This condemnes the carnall hoſpitalitie in the world, which promiſcuouſly admits any of any profeſſion, where the baſeſt and vileſt ſort of people are ſooneſt choſen for the table and company: yea many of the better ſort are to be blamed, ſuch as are ouer credulous, many times to their owne ſingular diſgrace, and hurt of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That when we are aſſured of the faithfulneſſe of any, we receiue them with all chriſtian reſpect, freely and liberally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.17. bearing with their infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. yea if need be, pardoning their offences, <hi>Phil.</hi> 12.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in ſociety with weake Chriſtians, we take heede of intangling them with queſtions and controuerſies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. as the manner of ſome is.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. They are happy in the perſonall prerogatiues of the kingdome, for 1. Here is certaine ſafetie and quiet habitation for all the Kings ſubiects Iſa. 33.20.21. Ier. 23.5.6. Secondly, to all the ſubiects it is giuen to know the myſteries of this kingdome, Math. 13.11. Thirdly, in this kingdome poore men may get aduancement as eaſily and as ſoone as rich, Iam. 2.6. Fourthly, if any of the ſubiects fall into deſperate croſſes that they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all meanes, yet they are priſoners of hope, and ſhall be ſaued and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the bloud of the couenant, Zach. 9.9.11. Fiftly, the King doth quiet himſelfe in the loue of euery ſubiect and doth reioyce ouer them with ioy, it is a great benefit to liue vnder a good King though the ſubiect be not knowne vnto him: but a great fauour that the King ſhould take notice of the ſubiect by name; but exceeding great comfort it is if the King loue ſome ſubiect with a ſpeciall loue: thus doth Chriſt to all his ſubiects, which no King can doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his heart is finite.

Thirdly, practiſe what thou praieſt, and by practiſe ſeeke the kingdome of God firſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33. and to this end obſerue 4. rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remoue what might hinder, that is by repentance caſt off thy ſinnes, no vncleane thing muſt enter here, and it is plaine it is required, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2. Secondly, waite vpon the preaching of the Goſpell, for it is the Goſpell of the kingdome, and the keies of heauen, onely take heede thou neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it by ſecurity, nor choake it by care, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. Thirdly, remember to ſeeke it with all zeale and earneſtneſſe, for the kingdome of heauen ſuffers violence and the violent take it by force, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.12. Fourthly, take heed thou giue not ouer when thou come neere to the kingdome of God, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.34. for the children of the kingdome may be caſt out.</p>

Secondly, to reioyce in their King, and ſpeake of the praiſes of the great renowne of the ſacred Kingdome that thus commeth in the name of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.10.11. &amp; 149.2. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.10. for many Prophets and great kings haue deſired to ſee ſuch daies, and haue not ſeene them, in that cleereneſſe we now ſee them. Thirdly, willingly to ſuffer for righteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly Miniſters ſhould here be informed and prouoked by all meanes poſſible, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon to exhort, perſwade, beſeech men, and turne themſelues into all formes to preuaile, for it is about a kingdome they labour.</p>
                  <p>Thus for inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſerues for reproofe, firſt, of ſuch as can be ſo eaſily content either to want or loſe the meanes, the kingdome of God is taken from them, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.43. Secondly, of the waiwardneſſe of caueling hearers that can neuer be ſet downe but are ſtill obiecting, againſt this word of doctrine or the eſtate of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4894:269"/> Chriſtians, theſe are condemned, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.16. &amp;c. Thirdly, it is a great terrour to rich men in ſpeciall, who are threatned with impoſſibilitie to enter into this kingdome, if they doe not aboue all other men looke to themſelues, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.23.24. Fourthly, of the diſcontentments of Gods ſeruants vnder croſſes, is there no king in <hi>Sion?</hi> or is it no priuiledge that the firſt Dominion is come vnto them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.9. Fiftly, it ſpecially reprooues thoſe wicked perſons that profeſſe by their workes they will not haue Chriſt to raigne ouer them by his word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14.27. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.17. woe is vnto them, and woe to ſuch as ſhut vp the kingdome of God before men, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For comfort to all Gods ſeruants. Did ſo great Kings and Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee theſe things we ſee? what is it to enioy ſuch a Kingdome? was it a great offer in <hi>Herod</hi> to offer halfe his kingdome, what is it in God to giue a whole Kingdome, better then any kingdome on earth? yea this comfort is the greater, in that ſuch chriſtians whoſe grace is but like the graine of muſtard ſeede, may be poſſeſſed of this Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which haue beene to my conſolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> The labours of Gods ſeruants are a great comfort vnto good men, it is a comfort to ſee Gods worke proſper, and beſides ioy in the holy Ghoſt is wrought in their hearts by the power of the word preached.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What ſhould be the reaſon,<note place="margin">Why many hearers haue no more comfort in hearing.</note> why many that come conſtantly to heare Gods ſeruants, yet get not conſolation, or not the comfort they deſire?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The lets of comfort are either 1. in men, or 2. in God.</p>
                  <p>In men they are either of frailty without any great ſinne, or ſuch as ariſe of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>The lets of frailtie are ſpecially two. 1. Bodily diſtemper by ſickneſſe or melancholy, but this may be tried thus if they bee dead hearted in all other things aſwell as hearing and praier, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Waiwardneſſe in the diſtreſſe of conſcience when the ſoule refuſeth comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3.</p>
                  <p>The lets of comfort that ariſe of ſinne may be conſidered two waies, firſt as they are in the worſer ſort of men. Secondly, as they are alſo in the better ſort. In the worſer ſort theſe are the lets; Firſt impenitencie, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6.8. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, peruerſnes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.10. Thirdly, vile affections, ſuch as are:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Worldly griefe or fretting. 2. Worldly cares, theſe are thornes. 3. Rage and paſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 4. Luſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. 5. Enuie, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A ſpirit of ſlumber, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7.8. &amp;c. 5. Contrariety or contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in opinions, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1.2.</p>
                  <p>In the better ſort 1. want of preparation, plowing muſt go before ſowing, <hi>Math.</hi> 17. Of attention, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3.4. Of eſtimation of comfort receiued <hi>Iob.</hi> 15.11. Of godly ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.62.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Preuailing of other ioyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An ouer high expectation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Preſumptuous ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Spirituall ſatiety and fulneſſe, when they ſeeme to haue grace enough, and want nothing, too like the <hi>Laodiceans, Reuel.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Thus in men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God doth reſtraine conſolation, ſometimes for reaſons ſecret to himſelfe, ſometimes for reaſons reuealed, but not to vs, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To teach vs to know that comfort is his gift, and to draw vs to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the meanes. 2. To teach vs to liue by faith and not by ſenſe. 3. To ſcourge vnthankfulneſſe. 4. To compell vs to the vſe of other of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, too much neglected.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the lets.</p>
                  <p>To paſſe from this point we may here obſerue, 1. An imitable praiſe in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4894:270"/> Apoſtle, he enuies not the labours of his brethren, he is ſo farre from it that he reioyceth in it. 2. We may ſee that the wiſeſt and greateſt men haue need to be comforted of meaner men. 3. Here is a reproofe of ſuch workemen as by their labour grieue Gods people, and are as thornes and goades in their ſides but comfort them they doe not.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſalutations of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>The ſalutations of the three Gentiles follow, the firſt is <hi>Epaphras</hi> who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the report of his ſalutation) is deſcribed 1. by his office, the ſeruant of Chriſt. 2. By his relation to them, who is one of you. 3. By his loue to them ſhewed by ſtriuing in praier for them. 4. By his zeale not onely for them but for the two neighbour Churches, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Epaphras</hi> was the Cities preacher among the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he is kept back at <hi>Rome</hi> for a time that ſo <hi>Tichicus</hi> might confirme the doctrine before taught by <hi>Epaphras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why is the Apoſtle ſo long in ſpeaking of him being ſo ſhort in the mention of the reſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the Apoſtles diſcretion to honour him before his owne people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſeruant of Chriſt]</hi> He was a ſeruant of Chriſt, firſt, as a man and ſo by the neceſſitie of creation he muſt ſerue Chriſt whether he would or not. 2. As a Chriſtian man and ſo he ſerues him willingly and in religious workes. 3. As a Preacher of the Goſpell, and ſo he ſerues Chriſt in a ſpeciall function in the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Miniſters are Chriſts ſeruants, whence followes two things, firſt they muſt doe his workes. Secondly, they muſt not be ſeruants of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2, The eſtate of the Miniſters of God is an eſtate of ſeruing not of raigning, they are not Lords ouer Gods heritage, nor muſt they thinke to be like the Prince of the Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. It is a great honour to be Chriſts ſeruant; for all his ſeruants are freemen, and their wages is euerlaſting: and therefore wee ſhould loue to be his ſeruants, neither ſhould it euer ſeeme euill vnto vs to doe his worke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is a great comfort to poore Chriſtians, though they cannot be Kings and Apoſtles, yet they may be Chriſts ſeruants which Kings and Apoſtles haue accounted their greateſt honour. Thirdly, men muſt take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing or abuſing Miniſters, ſeeing they are Chriſts ſeruants, yea it is not ſafe to abuſe any Chriſtian for that very reaſon. Laſtly, ſeeing it is ſo great a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to ſerue Chriſt, both Miniſters and people muſt be carefull to performe Chriſts ſeruice, with obſeruation of what Chriſt requires, for the manner or rules of his ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Miniſters muſt not ſeeke their owne things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. they muſt not bee giuen to wine, nor to filthy lucre, nor fighters, nor couetous, not prophane in their families, not young ſchollers, not ſcandalous, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.4.5.6.7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. they muſt faithfully care for all the matters of the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.20. they muſt ſerue with all modeſtie and teares, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.19.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians in their ſeruice of Chriſt muſt remember to lay aſide all immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate cares for the profits and pleaſures of this world: yee <hi>cannot ſerue Chriſt and mammon.</hi> 2. That Chriſt will not be ſerued but in newneſſe of ſpirit: the old heart can doe Chriſt no worke Chriſt will accept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Who are Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But who are Chriſts ſeruants?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you ſpeake of Miniſters, it is anſwered negatiuely, <hi>Gal</hi> 1.10. He that preacheth mans doctrine, or goeth about to pleaſe men, he is not the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Chriſt. If you aske of Chriſtians in generall, it is anſwered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. His ſeruants ye are to whom ye obey. If ye conſcionably endeauour to obey, the word of Chriſt, you are the ſeruants of Chriſt; otherwiſe yee ſerue ſinne vnto death.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:4894:270"/>
                  <p>For concluſion, let vs ſo ſettle our hearts to ſerue Chriſt, that we remember to doe it, 1. conſtantly at all times, 2. ſincerely by doing all his works both publike and priuate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which is one of you] Doct.</hi> There is a ſpeciall loue due to fellow-citizens. This I haue noted before. But I adde, that the loue of Citizens muſt ſhunne fiue things, as great rockes to make the ſhipwracke of true affection vpon: 1. Oppoſition or quarrell and ſuits in matter of eſtate. 2. Enuie at the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or trade of others. 3. Faction or banding into ſides in matters of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. Schiſme in matter of Religion: but it is to be noted, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and fleſhly men that haue not the ſpirit of God, that cannot abide others becauſe they runne not with them into the ſame exceſſe of riot, for Gods ſeruants would faine liue at peace, <hi>Iud.</hi> 18.19. 5. A reioycing together in euill. The loue that leads men from their calling to go from tauerne to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, or from ſport to ſport, is not true Citizen like loue, it is baſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in the deſcription is his loue to his people, ſhewed by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them. In his praier note.</p>

                     <hi>Praier.] Doct.</hi> Praier is the vſuall remedie and refuge for Gods children in their griefes and deſires: a remedie I ſay for all times, perſons, and places.<note place="margin">The force of praier.</note> As for griefes and feares, it is of force and auaileable, 1. againſt the troubles and cares of this world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. 2. againſt the ſtings of ſecret tentations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing ſinnes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 3. againſt the ſhame of euill workes paſt, both the bluſhing and gnawing of the conſcience inwardly, and outwardly the reproach of name, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.11. 4. againſt ſickneſſe, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.15. 5. againſt ill tongues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.4. 6. againſt the feare of apoſtacie, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. And theſe are the moſt vſuall things that need to trouble any childe of God. And as for deſires, it is a plaine propoſition, that God is rich to all that call vpon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. This ſhewes the felicitie of euery childe of God, to whom God hath giuen the ſpirit of his ſonne into his heart as a ſpirit of praier; for we ſee he cannot be miſerable that can pray: and it ſhould teach vs that if wee would be counted Gods people to ſhew that we truſt God, by pouring out our hearts before him in all places and at all times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4894:271"/> affection in praier, there is praier vnto which is required the vſuall deuotion of the heart, and there is ſupplication which is with ſpeciall inſtance and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. Thirdly, by the inſtrument, there is the praier of the mouth, and the praier of the heart. Fourthly, by the matter, for there is deprecations for turning away of iudgement, and confeſſions with acknowledgment of ſinne, and petition in matters of requeſt, and thankeſgiuing for benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Striueth.]</hi> But why muſt we ſtriue in praier? Becauſe of the greatnes of our owne wants &amp; neceſſities, and becauſe it is a great loſſe to loſe our praiers.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what doth ſtriuing import? It imports earneſtneſſe as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to coldneſſe, when we draw neere to God with our lips, but our hearts are farre from him: or to ſpirituall fainting in praier, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. Secondly, tenderneſſe of affection, both ſorrowing and reioicing in praier, according to our occaſions, and the matter of praier. Thirdly, a reſolution to take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. Fourthly, difficultie, for fighting imports oppoſition.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Eight things vve muſt fight againſt in praier.</note>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what muſt we fight againſt in praier? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Carnall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. 2. Diſtractions by the luſts of the fleſh or cares of the world, 3. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of our owne fleſh. 4. Our owne vnskilfulneſſe to pray, ſtriue to learne to pray better. 5. Hardneſſe of heart. 6. Sleepineſſe of our body. 7. The temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan. 8. Wee muſt ſtriue againſt God himſelfe, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did by wreſtling to get the bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> For reproofe of ſuch as neuer complaine of any impediments in praier, nor care how they ſpeed: their condition is as farre from happineſſe, as their practiſe is from duty. And they are to be blamed, that complaine of their lets and diſcomforts in praier, but yet they ſtriue not. But wee ſhould learne to harneſſe our ſelues,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and conſcionably ſtriue againſt all that may hinder vs; and to this end ſet our ſelues in Gods preſence, and beſeech God to heale our infirmities, and helpe vs againſt all the lets of prayer, and ſtirre vp in our hearts the promiſes made to praier, obſeruing fit times, and watching to all opportunities, to be importunate when any doore is opened.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, would one be feruent in ſpirit? They muſt then looke to 4. things. Firſt, they muſt ſerue the Lord; for a prophane perſon can neuer be feruent. Secondly, they muſt labour to reioyce their ſoules with the hope of a better life; for ſuch comfortable meditations inflame the ſpirit. Thirdly, wee muſt get patience vnder worldly croſſes and tribulations, elſe the cares and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world will choake all true feruencie. Fourthly, wee muſt continue in praier, for vſe and experience breeds feruencie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alwaies]</hi> We muſt be conſtant in praier, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36. To pray alwaies, is to keepe a conſtant order in the daily performance of this dutie, and beſides to pray vpon all occaſions and opportunities. The profit comes by this conſtancie in praier, appeares by the proofes to bee 1. much ioy, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16. 2. they that pray continually, ſhall eſcape the laſt terrible things, and be able to ſtand in the day of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36.</p>
                  <p>Here wee may ſee the difference betweene a godly minde and a carnall heart. The godly minde is alwaies praying, but the carnall heart is ſeldome without a ſenſe of tediouſneſſe, with a deſire to be rid of the burthen of it.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why Gods children be ſo willingly imploied in much and often praier, is partly becauſe God commands them to pray alwaies, partly becauſe they finde vnutterable benefit and refreſhing in praier, and partly they daily get hereby what they deſire, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.24.</p>
                  <p>If any take vnto them the words of thoſe wretched Iewes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. and ſay what profit is it to keepe Gods Commandements, or to walke humbly, and that they could neuer finde any good by it, I can ſoone anſwere that in their praiers and obedience there was no profit, for indeede they did not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4894:271"/> walke humbly, nor in the power of godlineſſe did they keepe Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But haue not the beſt of them all, their ſinnes, diſtractions and wants, as well as others? how then can they be ſo bold and frequent in praier?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The children of God haue priuiledges, others haue not; for their wants are couered by Chriſts interceſſion, and their ſuites are followed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Chriſts aduocation, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. and framed in earth by the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can they finde matter for ſo much praier?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> If men had by the law gathered the catalogues of their ſinnes, and learned to ſee and feare the iudgements ſinne might bring, if they had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the daily ſtraits of a mortall condition, if they had conſidered the almoſt infinite occaſions of praier for themſelues and others, they would not thus obiect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But there are ſome that doe pray, and that alwaies too, againſt their corruptions, and yet cannot ſpeed, nor get ſtrength againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> If they haue conſtantly praied (which yet I doubt) then the reaſon is either they watch not in practiſe to cut off the occaſions of euill, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.36. or they ſtriue not with importunitie to preuaile with God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18 or elſe they cannot be truely affected towards Gods grace in others: for if enuie at the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and eſtimation of others raigne in thee, it is iuſt with God to deny to giue thee that grace thou enuieſt in others.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, if any man hitherto careleſſe of this dutie, be now deſirous to be inſtruſted how to pray as he ought, with words, affection, and ſucceſſe, let ſuch a man put on a minde to obſerue the rules following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou muſt forgiue all thine enemies,<note place="margin">Rules for praier.</note> and reſolue to liue without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou muſt conſtantly heare Gods word, elſe thou canſt neuer pray, but God will abhorre thee and thy praiers, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou muſt get and ſhew a mercifull heart to man, if thou wouldeſt preuaile to obtaine mercy with God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou muſt carry thy ſelfe orderly and quietly in the familie, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Take heed of hypocriſie in praying to be ſeen of men, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But I want words. <hi>Sol.</hi> Pray God to giue thee words, and minde thine owne way, by conſidering thy ſinne and wants, by the law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But I want the affections of praier. <hi>Sol.</hi> Search whether there be not ſome vile affections, luſts and paſſions vnmortified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. and pray God to giue thee the ſpirit of compaſſion, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12. Yet in all this take heed of ſecuritie, reſt not in beginnings: God will take that at the firſt, which he will not ſtill be content with. Learne to pray better.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the ſixt thing.</p>
                  <p>The laſt is the matter he praies for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ye may ſtand.]</hi> Concerning perſeuerance here are foure things to be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That in the viſible Church there may be ſuch as will not ſtand: and this is true both in true members, and in ſeeming members. The true members may fall either by infirmitie, and ſo the righteous falleth ſeuen times, and riſeth againe, or by preſumption, falling to the practiſe of groſſe euils, out of which they cannot recouer, but with extreame ſorrowes. The onely ſeeming members, not only may, but certainly will fall, and that moſt an end finally, without recouery. So <hi>Demas, Iudas, Ioaſh,</hi> and many moe. This ſhould teach vs, not to thinke it ſtrange if wee ſee apoſtacie in men that haue roomes in the Church, and haue acknowledged the truth according to godlineſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:4894:272"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The miſerie of ſuch as fall avvay.</note>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That it is a fearefull thing to fall away, a worſe condition likely a man cannot chuſe for himſelfe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.21. For Satan will re-enter, and gaine a ſtronger poſſeſſion then euer he had, yea their diſpoſitions vnto euill may ſeuen times more be enflamed then euer before; ſeuen deuils worſe then the former may enter. It were better to be ground vnder a milſtone, then thus to liue in apoſtacie, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.44. ſuch perſons are aboliſhed from Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. They are in the power of Satan, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. laſt. Their latter end is worſe then their beginning. It had been better for them neuer to haue knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then hauing knowne it to depart from the holy commandement giuen vnto them. They are as hatefull to God as dogges and ſwine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.21.22. yea they may ſo order the matter, that they may fall into ſuch a condition as there will remaine no more ſacrifice for ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what ſhould be the cauſes of their apoſtacie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The cauſes of falling avvay.</note>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The cauſes are either without them, or in themſelues.

                  <p>Within themſelues, the cauſes are in ſome vnbeleefe<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.</note>, in ſome pride and the vanitie of our owne conceits<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>vlt.</hi>

                  <p>Hence wee may diſcerne the ſtate of the ſoule of a Chriſtian, it is like a veſſell vnder the conduit pipe of Gods ordinances filling more and more, by the influence of Chriſt till it come to be brim-full.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may ſee cauſe to be greatly humbled, becauſe our workes are not full before God.</p>
                  <p>Now if any ſhall thinke this doctrine of fulneſſe to bee a doctrine of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4894:273"/> he may note theſe things for remoouall of that obiection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is a kingdome men labour about, and therefore ſhould not think much if much be required of them. 2. We may fill ſpiritually, though we do not diſcerne it. 3. God requires not fulneſſe at firſt, but by degrees. 4. That the Lord hath in many Scriptures, promiſed to help vs, againſt all tentations and impediments, whether ariſing from our owne weakeneſſe, or from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In all the will of God.] Caietan</hi> a Papiſt makes a ſtop at, all, and reads it, in euery thing, by the will of God, and deliuers the ſenſe thus: That ye may be conſummate, in reſpect of your ſelues, and full in reſpect of others in euery ſpirituall thing, by the will of God, that is, not by your owne merits (note that) but by the grace of Gods will.</p>
                  <p>But I thinke it ſhould be read, as ordinarily it is read, and ſo I obſerue that we ſhould take counſell for the informing of our faith and reforming and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of our liues, at the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Which ſerues for great reproofe, of the courſe of the moſt men, who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and guided, either by carnall reaſon, or by the luſts and wils of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall friends, or the luſts and tentations of Satan, himſelfe<note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44.</note>, or the inclination of their owne fleſh, how are worlds of men ſwayed by theſe or ſome of theſe, almoſt in all matters of religion: if reformation and the practiſe of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Goſpell, may not get the conſent of their owne carnall reaſon, or of ſuch and ſuch friends, &amp;c. then it muſt neuer be gone about. But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we ſhould learne to ſticke to Gods will in all things, yea we ſhould pray earneſtly, that we might neuer be beaten from this Anchor hold, but that in all eſtates, in proſperitie and aduerſitie, in life and death, we might conſtantly exalt the glory of Gods will, to yeeld it for euer our acknowledgement of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty ouer vs<note n="m" place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, note here that wee muſt reſpect all Gods will, and thus wee are tyed to reſpect all the will of God, both in reſpect of knowledge, &amp; in reſpect of practiſe, for we ſhould labour to be made <hi>rich in all things, in all kinde of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and in all knowledge</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This may ſerue firſt for confutation of the Papiſts, that will not allow the will of God to be the onely rule, though they grant it to be a perfect rule. But let vs deteſt that ſubtle diſtinction, and in the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, acknowledge that there is a will of God, for euery opinion and worke of euery man of God, ſufficient to make him perfect in all knowledge, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good worke<note n="p" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if this doctrine were ſoundly vrged thorough euerie commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would ranſack the hearts of carnal men, and then manifeſtly let them ſee,<note place="margin">The arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ciuill honeſt man.</note> the vanitie of their falſe and wilde preſumption of ciuilitie and Gods li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them and their honeſt meanings; It is true, they dare not ſay with their tongues, there is no God, but is there not ſuch talke in their hearts? or could they not wiſh there were no God<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. That the care of faithfull Teachers, and their deſire to do good extends to other Churches, alſo hence they are compared fitly to ſtarres that giue light not only to the orbe in which they are, but to places further of, and this good Miniſters may do by praier, example of faithfulneſſe and diligence, or by counſell or writing, or confirmation of doctrine, by preaching as there is occaſion. And this ſhewes the worth of painfull and ſincere Teachers: they are a great benefit, to the whole countrey, where they liue, and therefore they ſhould be protected, and incouraged, by all them that would be accounted louers of their countrey.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Miniſters owe a ſpecial loue and care to the neighbour Churches, for as neereneſſe of habitation increaſeth the ſtrength of ciuill bonds, ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4894:275"/> ſhould it much more in ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the care of other Churches ſhould not cauſe men to neglect the flocke that depends vpon them, it is not ſufficient that men preach ſomwhere God cals for an account of their ſtewardſhip in their owne charge, they muſt tend their owne heards, he were a ſtrange Husbandman that would plow his neighbours field, and let his owne lie vntilled, it is vile corruption, to be intent when we labour for others, and remiſſe when we labour for our owne people.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That Phiſicke hath beene of ancient honour and vſe in the Church, we ſee it here in the Apoſtles time, and it was long before alſo for there were Phiſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Such as totally neglect them, though they haue neede to vſe them, yet our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith <hi>the ſicke neede a Phiſition</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">o</hi>: 2. Such as are waiward and will not be cured, that is ſuch as through impatiencie will not be ordered by this meanes, in the manner they ſhould be. 3. Such as put their whole truſt in phiſicke, as <hi>Aſa</hi> did, neglecting to ſeeke vnto God for helpe: yea it is to be noted in <hi>Aſa,</hi> that his diſeaſe being but ordinary yet to neglect the Lord in it was a great ſinne, for though God hath allowed phiſicke as an helpe, yet it was neuer his meaning to robbe himſelfe of his owne glory. 4. Such as will out of pride and niceneſſe, be tampering with their bodies in phiſicke, when there is no need, contrarie to that of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>The whole neede not the Phiſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in as much as many times it is manifeſt, phiſicke doth no good to the diſeaſed we are to vnderſtand three things, firſt that this may be the fault of careleſſe and ignorant Phiſitians. 2. That as we grow monſters in the world by ſinning, ouer-paſſing the deedes of the wicked, ſo the Lord ſometimes by bringing in ſtrong and new diſeaſes doth ouerpaſſe the skill of the Phiſitians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God for ſinnes or triall may reſtraine the bleſſing vpon the meanes, which elſe would be auaileable.</p>
                  <p>The third thing I note, is that the holy Ghoſt giues this praiſe to a godly Phiſitian, importing that a Phiſitian ſhould be a man ſound in religion, and zealous for the truth, and knowne and beloued in the Church, for as it is certaine, godly and religious Phiſitians may doe much good, in the dangers of their patients, ſo miſerable experience ſhewes that popiſh and ſuperſtitious Phiſitians, doe exceeding much hurt, by working vpon thoſe opportunities, to ſeduce and peruert men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Demas]</hi> This is that <hi>Demas</hi> that afterward forſooke <hi>Paul,</hi> and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this preſent world, from the conſideration of whoſe eſtate wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the vices of men by the profeſſion of the truth may bee reſtrained when they are not cured. This mans loue of the world was in him, when he was at the beſt, but it was curbed and held downe, and ſo it is with many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and therefore men ſhould be warned and looke to themſelues, that they be not deceiued, by taking the reſtraint of the outward practiſe of ſome euill, for the true mortification of them.</p>
                  <p>It is many times a great hand of God vpon vnſound hearted men, that at their beſt they are ſeene into, and not greatly eſteemed, it ſeemes it was ſo with this man, for if we marke it the Apoſtle not only reckons him in the laſt place, but he names him alſo without any manner of praiſe, as if he would import
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4894:276"/> that hee durſt not commend him to the Churches. Wee ſhould here learne what to doe towards ſuch from the example of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Now if any would know more fully what is to be done, and how they ſhould carry themſelues towards ſuch as they iuſtly doubt and feare not to be right, though they make profeſſion: there are three rules to be obſerued.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">3. Rules for our practiſe concerning ſuch as vvee ſuſpect in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>1. Pity them, pray for them, and admoniſh them. 2. Commit not thy ſelfe vnto them, but bee well aduiſed before thou conuerſe inwardly with them. It is true that the practiſe of this rule is ſtrangly cenſured, when thoſe kinde of people, perceiue themſelues, not to be regarded ſo much as they would bee, for vſually if in diſcretion, men prooue before they truſt, they are taxed of pride and haughtineſſe: yet conſidering the vile hypocriſie that is in many, it is better to be ſo cenſured without cauſe, then to be beguiled by men that make their religion but a cloake to their owne ends.</p>
                  <p>The third rule is that while they ſtand and fall not into open ſinne, thou maieſt not traduce them, but conceale thy diſlikes, till God lay them open, vnleſſe greater danger might enſue by the concealement, for the Lord may make him ſound, and giue him repentance, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not diſpraiſe <hi>Demas</hi> here, as he doth not commend him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may in this man note the propertie of many hypocrites, they will not be diſcountenanced, they are vſually impudent, this man thruſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the Apoſtles company, and will be commended to the Churches: he will haue a place though it be the laſt place.</p>

                  <p>By the Church hee meanes thoſe in the houſhold that feare God, whether they were women, or children, or ſeruants.</p>
                  <p>Now here firſt I conſider of theſe perſons, and then of the title the Apoſtle giues them in calling them a Church.</p>
                  <p>In that the Apoſtle thus with honor remembers the houſhold of <hi>Nymphas,</hi> it ſhewes his ſingular vprightneſſe, in that he can reſpect grace in whomſoeuer hee finde it, hee loues a good ſeruant as well as a good maſter, and can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend good order in an houſhold as well as in a congregation. This ſhould teach vs not to haue the grace of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, and hereby alſo we may trie our loue to Gods children, by examining our ſelues whether wee can loue ſuch as can neither profit or pleaſure vs, nor grace vs in the world. And this may be a great incouragement to the young and meaner ſort, in that they may perceiue from hence, that if they get true grace, they ſhall be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both of God and good men.</p>
                  <p>Now in that the Apoſtle cals this houſhold a Church, wee may note,<note place="margin">A religious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie is a little Church. The vſes of it.</note> that a religious and well ordered familie is as it were a little Church. Here in one familie is preſcribed what all families ſhould bee: this familie is called a Church, becauſe his people were godly, and the word of God was read there, and praiers made to God, and Pſalmes ſung, and the younger ſort were cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized and inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>Now doe we learne from hence that our houſes are Churches? Then theſe things will follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Gods worſhip and pietie muſt be ſet vp in them.<note place="margin">4. Orders in the familie.</note> How can they be Churches of God, if God be not ſerued in them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All muſt be done therein order, and quietneſſe, and ſilence, for ſo it is or ſhould be in the Church.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The husband or maſter of the familie muſt dwell there as a man of knowledge, and wiues, children and ſeruants muſt obey as the Church doth Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, are our families Churches? Why then religious families are in a happie caſe, for then God himſelfe will dwell there: ſo as a ſtranger comming to ſuch places, may ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> did of <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſurely God is in this place.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſhould our families be Churches? Oh then woe vnto the world of prophane houſholds. Should a Church be without ſacrifice? and can their families eſcape Gods wrath, ſeeing there is neither praier nor pietie in them, but in ſtead of Gods ſeruice, there is curſing, and ſwearing, and lying, and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and filching, and whoring, and railing, and fighting, and what not? The moſt families are very cages of vncleane ſpirits, where not God or good men, but very deuils dwell, they are very ſties of vncleanneſſe and vnholineſſe.</p>

                     <hi>This Epiſtle.]</hi> In that this Epiſtle may not be neglected, but muſt be read, it ſhewes that whatſoeuer is reuealed to the Church, to be a part of the word of God, it muſt be read: ſo ſoone as this Epiſtle is written, it muſt bee read of all Chriſtians, which ſhewes that euery part of Gods word is to be read.</p>
                  <p>Now for the perſons that muſt reade the Scriptures, it is here ſet downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely <hi>(of you)</hi> meaning of all ſorts of people, which is in other parts of the word of God diſtinctly expreſſed.

                  <p>The vſe may be to ſtirre vs vp to doe it, and to doe it conſtantly, for the ſame word of God that requires it to be done, ſhewes it ſhould bee done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: we muſt reade all the dayes of our life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. and that daily, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. day and night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. they reade 4. times a day, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.4.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The cauſes vvhy ſo many profit not by reading the vvord.</note>I anſwer diuerſly: 1. Some men are poiſoned with the inclinations of Atheiſme and ſecuritie, they come to the word to obſerue it, not to let the word obſerue them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many ſeeke not a bleſſing by praier: whereas it is certaine the fleſh will not of it ſelfe ſauour the things of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men bring not an humble and meeke ſpirit, whereas vnto the fruitfull meditation of the word, a heart quiet and patient, and a minde free from pride and paſſion is requiſite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men lay not downe their cares and luſts, they haue marred their taſte before they come, they doe not empty their heads, and ſeparate themſelues to ſeeke the wiſdome of the word, care or luſt will choake the word.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Men reade not all Gods word, nor doe they reade conſtantly, they will not wait daily at the gates of wiſdome: to reade ſeldome, or by ſtarts and here and there, will doe little good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. One great cauſe of not profiting, is the not ſeeking of the Law at the Prieſts mouth, that is, want of conference and propounding of doubts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In many, vnprofitableneſſe is the ſcourge of vnthankfulneſſe for the good they haue found in reading.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In reading men do not <hi>minde their owne way,</hi> for if men did propoſe vnto themſelues what ſinne of their owne they might finde rebuked, and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections might be collected out of that they reade for their liues, or did note
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:4894:277"/> how the word did offer comfort when they need it, they could not but finde many excellent experiences of Gods prouidence and power in the word, they could not liue in any ſinne, but either reading or hearing would diſcouer it, nor could they goe long without ſome word of comfort when they needed it, yea they might obſerue how God in the word they reade did counſell them too when they were in diſtreſſe, therefore let him that readeth marke, and reade for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the cauſe is in the moſt, that their hearts are not turned to God, and ſo the vaile is not taken away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe to be read.]</hi> Obſerue here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is not enough to reade our ſelues, but wee muſt cauſe others to reade, by exhorting, incouraging, commanding, &amp;c. eſpecially Parents and Miniſters ſhould ſee to it, ſo ſhould Magiſtrates alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the coherence note, that we muſt cauſe others to reade, when wee haue read our ſelues: it is vile hypocriſie for a Miniſter or Parent to vrge their children or ſeruants to reade the Scriptures, when they neglect reading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Church.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we haue a plaine proofe for reading of the Scriptures publikely in the Church, we ſee it was anciently both required and practiſed. Adde for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation hereof theſe places, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11.12. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. And this may aſſure vs, 1. That publike reading is no inuention or ordinance of man. 2. That the people of God haue found in all ages great need of this helpe. And therefore they are miſerably tranſported with humor, that ſo vilifie or neglect this ordinance of God, and it may bee iuſt with God, that thou ſhouldſt not profit by reading at home, when thou careſt not for reading in the Church. Thus of the reading of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epiſtle from Laodicea.]</hi> Here is a great adoe among Interpreters to finde out what Epiſtle this was.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Theophylact</hi> thinkes it was the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> another towne of that name, not this <hi>Laodicea</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke <hi>Paul</hi> did write an Epiſtle to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which was Apocrypha: and ſo <hi>Dionyſius</hi> tels of a third Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians. Iacobus Stapulenſis</hi> cauſed ſuch an Epiſtle to bee printed, but <hi>Catharinus</hi> could eaſily auouch that it was a baſtard and counterfet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some thinke the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> wrote to the Apoſtle, and propounded their doubts, vnto which the Apoſtle hath anſwered in this Epiſtle: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required that his anſwer might be compared with their doubts: this is the moſt publike opinion.</p>
                  <p>But in the generall it ſhewes vs thus much, that wee muſt reade other good bookes as well as Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the 16. verſe.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words concerne the Coloſſean Preacher, who is not onely ſaluted, but exhorted.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Archippus</hi> (as it ſeemes) was their Paſtor, ioyned with <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who was now at <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Paul:</hi> it is likely he was growne negligent in teaching, and careleſſe, and idle.<note place="margin">Painfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers many times grovv idle.</note>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:4894:278"/>1. Sometimes from very diſcouragements from their people, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they profit not, or becauſe they weary their Teachers with indignities and wrongs: thus the very Prophets haue beene ſometimes ſo tired, that they could haue been almoſt willing neuer to ſpeake more in the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes this comes from the corruption of their owne natures, they grow ſoone weary of Gods worke, or elſe hauing taken more worke to doe then they are ſufficient for, they grow to neglect all, or elſe they are drawne away with the loue of the world, or elſe forbeare of purpoſe to preach often, leſt they ſhould be thought to be too preciſe; or elſe to winne applauſe, they ſet out at firſt with ſuch a ſtrife to ſeeme eloquent &amp; learned, that they quickly ſpend their ſtore, and then rather then they will be obſerued to want, they will giue ouer preaching.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes God himſelfe for the wickedneſſe of their liues caſts a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe vpon their hearts, and blaſteth their gifts.</p>
                  <p>In this exhortation foure things may be noted.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Say to Archippus.]</hi> Here I obſerue 7. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſinner muſt be told of his ſinne, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as offend publikely, muſt be told of it publikely.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Miniſters as well as others may be rebuked, though ſome Clergie men are ſo ſore and ſo proud, that they may not be touched: and many times it is a iuſt iudgment of God, that no man ſhould rebuke them, that their ſores might not be medicined, but like vnſauorie ſalt, they ſhould be caſt out of God. No mans learning or greatneſſe of place can ſo protect them, but that they may bee told of their faults: it is too commonly knowne they can ſinne as well as others, why then ſhould they not be rebuked as well as others?</p>
                  <p>Doth <hi>Archippus</hi> need to be told? The Lord be mercifull to the Land and Church. There bee many <hi>Archippuſſes</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had neede to be wakened with a loud trumpet of rebuke, and to be told of their faults, euen of their ignorance, ſilence, ſloth, pride, couetouſneſſe, ſimonie, diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ambition, contempt of their brethren, and ſoule-murder of many kinds.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The people may put their Teachers in minde of their faults: as they ought to incourage them in well doing, ſo may they admoniſh them for what is euill. Therefore Miniſters ſhould ſtriue ſo to liue, and ſo to teach, as their people ſhould not haue cauſe to finde fault.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Miniſters muſt be told of their faults by their people, with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and heedfulneſſe, and wiſdome, according to that direction, <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but exhort him as a Father;</hi> here they muſt <hi>ſay to Archippus,</hi> not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reproue him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They muſt ſay it to him, not ſay it of him: Miniſters ought not to be traduced behinde their backes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He doth not threaten him if he doe not, which implies, he hoped their exhortation would ſpeed: certainly tis a great praiſe to profit by admonition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take heed to thy miniſterie.]</hi> This take heed hath in it three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſideration, a weighing and meditation of the greatneſſe of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the dignitie of it, and the dutie alſo, with the accounts he muſt make to God and his high calling and the great price of ſoules, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It notes diuers of the worthy qualities of a Miniſter, as care, attendance, watchfulneſſe, aptneſſe to teach, and diuide the word aright, diſcretion, to giue euery one his portion, diligence, gentleneſſe, in not marring the doctrine with paſſion, patience to endure the worke and labour of his miniſterie, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:4894:278"/>3. It notes caution, and ſo Miniſters muſt take heed both of what is within them, and what is without them, they muſt take heed of their owne diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they muſt take heed of ſloth and idleneſſe, they muſt take heed of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of their owne fleſh, and the tentations of the Deuill, without them they muſt take heed of the new errors, that will daily riſe, they muſt take heed of the ſinnes of the people, with all the methods of Sathan in deuiſing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or defending of ſinne, they muſt take heede of mens fancies: and for perſons they muſt take heed of hypocrites, and open aduerſaries, dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall vipers, and forraine foes, falſe brethren and profeſt Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>The vſe may be for great reproofe of our ſleeping watchmen, and blinde guides, that take no heed to their miniſteries; Oh the woes that will fall vpon them, who can recount the miſeries that the bloud of ſoules, will bring vpon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which thou haſt receiued in the Lord]</hi> A Miniſter is ſaid to receiue his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie in the Lord in diuers reſpects. Firſt, becauſe it is Gods free grace, that he is choſen to be a Miniſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Secondly, becauſe hee is inwardly called and qualified by God. Thirdly, becauſe hee receiued his outward au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, though from men, yet by the direction and warrant of Gods word. Fourthly, becauſe he receiues it for the Lord, that is to Gods glory, and the furtherance of his kingdome, ouer the myſticall body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Vſe is threefold, Firſt the people ſhould therefore learne to ſeeke their Miniſters of God. Secondly, Miniſters ſhould hence learne, neither to bee proud nor idle, not proud for they receiued their Miniſterie of God, it was his gift not their deſerts, not idle for they are to doe Gods worke. Thirdly, Miniſters may hence gather, their owne ſafety notwithſtanding the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, that God that called them will perfect them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To fulfill it]</hi> Miniſters are ſaid to fulfill their miniſteries two waies. 1. By conſtancie, holding out in it to the end, to fulfill it is to go on, and not looke backe, when they are at plow. 2. By faithfull performance of it with a due reſpect of all the charge they haue receiued of God, thus to fulfill it is to ſhew the people all the counſell of God, it is to rebuke all ſorts of ſinnes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is faithfully to doe euery kind of worke, that belongs to their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie whether publike or priuate.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. As any haue beene more gracious, ſo they haue beene more ſtreitened, and oppreſt by the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The actions of great men are not alwaies iuſt, a worthy Apoſtle may be vnworthily impriſoned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The people ſhould be much affected with the troubles of their teachers, and therefore they are farre wide, that inſteed thereof trouble their teachers.</p>

                     <hi>Grace be with you]</hi> By grace hee meanes, both the loue of God and the gifts of Chriſt, as he began ſo he ends with vowes and wiſhes of grace, which ſhewes. 1. That in God we haue wonderfull reaſon continually to exalt the praiſe of his free grace and loue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in man there is no greater happineſſe then to be poſſeſt of the loue of God, and true grace, it is the richeſt portion, and faireſt inheritance on earth.</p>
                  <p>When he ſaith <hi>(be with you)</hi> It is as if he ſaid three thrings, 1. Be ſure you haue it, be not deceiued, nor ſatisfied till ye be infallibly certaine ye haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained true grace, and Gods loue. 2. Be ſure you looſe it not, neuer be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it matters not though ye loſe ſome credit or wealth or friends &amp;c. ſo you keepe grace ſtill with you. 3. Be ſure you vſe it and increaſe it, imploy it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, be continually in the exerciſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the whole Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>There followeth a poſtſcript or vnderwriting in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Written from Rome and ſent by Tichicus and Oneſimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is difference about the reading, ſome coppies haue not <hi>Tichicus and Oneſimus</hi> in ſome Latine copies read, <hi>Miſſa ab Epheſo.</hi> But the Greeke cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies generally agree that it was from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is no great matter for the certaintie of the reading, for the Reader muſt be admoniſhed, that the poſtſcripts are not part of the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture: But were added by the Scribes that wrote out the Epiſtles. If any deſire to be more particularly informed herein, he may peruſe a learned Tractate of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment publiſhed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rodulph Cudworth</hi> vpon the ſubſcription of the Epiſtle to the GALATHIANS.</p>
